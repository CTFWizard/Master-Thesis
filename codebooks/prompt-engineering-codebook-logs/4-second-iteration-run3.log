3. Exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the target machine's SSH service.

Note: The usage of automated scanners such as Nexus and OpenVAS is not allowed.1. Perform a port scan on the target machine using nmap.
- Use nmap to scan the target machine IP 10.10.11.214 ports. The command is `nmap -sV -sC -p- -oN nmap_scan.txt 10.10.11.214`.
- The expected outcome of this task is a list of open ports and services.

2. Investigate each open port and service for potential vulnerabilities.
- For port 22, use appropriate tools such as nikto, gobuster, or manual testing to identify potential weaknesses.
- The expected outcome of this task is a list of potential vulnerabilities for port 22.

3. Test each identified vulnerability for exploitability.
- Use appropriate tools or manual testing to verify if the identified vulnerabilities can be exploited.
- The expected outcome of this task is a list of exploitable vulnerabilities for port 22.

4. Exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
- Use appropriate tools or manual testing to exploit the identified vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to port 22.
- The expected outcome of this task is unauthorized access to the target machine's SSH service.

5. Maintain unauthorized access and escalate privileges.
- Use appropriate tools or manual testing to maintain unauthorized access and escalate privileges on the target machine.
- The expected outcome of this task is full control of the target machine with elevated privileges.

6. Perform post-exploitation activities.
- Use appropriate tools or manual testing to perform post-exploitation activities such as data exfiltration, installing backdoors, or covering tracks.
- The expected outcome of this task is the completion of the penetration testing.

Based on the given information and the tester's findings, the most favorable and most likely to lead to a successful exploit is to investigate the SSH service on port 22.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1. Use appropriate tools such as nikto, gobuster, or manual testing to identify potential weaknesses in the SSH service.
2. Verify if the identified vulnerabilities can be exploited.
3. Exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the target machine's SSH service.

Note: The usage of automated scanners such as Nexus and OpenVAS is not allowed.

The next task to perform is to investigate the SSH service on port 22.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1. Use appropriate tools such as nikto, gobuster, or manual testing to identify potential weaknesses in the SSH service.
2. Verify if the identified vulnerabilities can be exploited.
3. Exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the target machine's SSH service.

Note: The usage of automated scanners such as Nexus and OpenVAS is not allowed.
