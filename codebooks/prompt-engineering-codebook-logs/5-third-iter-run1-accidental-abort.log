   4.2 Exploit the vulnerability to gain access to the target system.

5. Post-Exploitation - [not applicable]

Note: The post-exploitation tasks are not applicable in this simulation environment.
Task: Perform a full port scan.

Command: nmap -sT -p- <target_IP>

Explanation: The nmap command is used to scan the target IP for open ports. The -sT option specifies a TCP scan, and the -p- option specifies a full port scan, scanning all ports from 1 to 65535. This will help identify all open ports on the target system, which will be useful for further exploration and vulnerability assessment.

Further guidance on the unknown service on port 50051/tcp:

1. Research the port number and service using online resources, such as portscan.net or similar websites.
2. Perform a manual banner grab or use a tool like netcat to connect to the port and retrieve the banner information.
3. Analyze the banner information to determine the purpose of the service.
4. If the service is still unknown after the above steps, consider using a tool like Wireshark to capture network traffic and analyze the communication between the client and the service.
5. If the service is still unknown after the above steps, consider using a tool like IDA Pro or Ghidra to reverse engineer the service's binary to understand its functionality better.1. Identify vulnerabilities or interesting behaviour on the services - (to-do)

2. Perform a manual banner grab or use a tool like netcat to connect to the port and retrieve the banner information.

To perform the task:

1. Use the command "nc -nv 10.10.11.214 50051" to connect to the service on port 50051 using netcat.
2. Observe the output for any banner information, such as the service name or version number, which may provide hints about the service's functionality.
