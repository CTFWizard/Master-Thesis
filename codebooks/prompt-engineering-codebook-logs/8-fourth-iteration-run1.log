Task: Perform a full port scan

Step 1: Choose a port scanning tool
To perform a full port scan, you'll need to choose a port scanning tool. Popular tools include Nmap, Unicornscan, and Masscan. In this example, we'll use Nmap.

Step 2: Install Nmap (if not already installed)
If Nmap is not installed on your system, you'll need to install it. You can download Nmap from the official website (https://nmap.org/) and install it according to the instructions for your operating system.

Step 3: Open a terminal or command prompt
To use Nmap, you'll need to open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

Step 4: Run the full port scan command
Once you have Nmap installed and a terminal or command prompt open, you can run the following command to perform a full port scan:

nmap -sS -p- <target_IP>

Replace <target_IP> with the IP address of the target system you want to scan. The -sS option tells Nmap to use TCP SYN scanning, which is a faster and more efficient method of scanning ports. The -p- option tells Nmap to scan all ports (from 0 to 65535).

Step 5: Review the scan results
After running the command, Nmap will scan all ports on the target system and display the results. The output will include the open, closed, and filtered ports, as well as any additional information Nmap can gather about the target system.

Remember to perform these steps with the appropriate permissions and follow all legal and ethical guidelines when performing penetration testing.
