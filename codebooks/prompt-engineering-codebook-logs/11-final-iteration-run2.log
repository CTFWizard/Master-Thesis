          1.3.2.2 Research identified service versions - (to-do)
Task: 1.3.1 Perform a full port scan

Guidance:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command to scan all ports using nmap:
```
nmap -p- <target_IP>
```
Replace `<target_IP>` with the IP address of the target system you want to scan.
3. Press Enter to execute the command.

Reason:
Performing a full port scan helps identify all open ports on the target system, which can be further analyzed to identify potential vulnerabilities.

Task: 1.3.1.2 Analyze nmap scan results

Guidance:

1. Review the output of the nmap scan.
2. Look for any open ports and note them down.
3. Investigate the port numbers and their corresponding services to understand their purpose.

Reason:
Analyzing the nmap scan results provides valuable information about the target system's open ports and services, which can be further exploited during the penetration testing process.

Summary:

1. Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.214
2. Host is up (0.027s latency)
3. Not shown: 65533 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
4. 22/tcp open ssh
5. OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
6. 50051/tcp open unknown

Interesting points:

1. OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 is running on port 22.
2. An unknown service is running on port 50051. Further investigation is required.1. Investigate OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 on port 22
2. Investigate unknown service on port 50051

The favorable sub-task to perform is "1. Investigate OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 on port 22". This is because SSH is a widely used protocol for secure remote access and file transfer, and it is more likely to have vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that can be exploited.

To perform this task, first, use the nmap script `ssh-version` to obtain more detailed information about the SSH version and configuration. Then, search for known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations related to the identified SSH version and configuration using a search engine or vulnerability database.

The nmap script to obtain more detailed information about the SSH version and configuration is:

nmap --script ssh-version 10.10.11.214

This script will provide information about the SSH version, cipher, and other configuration details.

Based on the provided information, no changes are needed in the PTT. The focus should still be on investigating the OpenSSH service on port 22, as it is more likely to have vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that can be exploited.

However, it is also important to continue investigating the gRPC service on port 50051, as it may have vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that can be exploited.

To perform the task of investigating the OpenSSH service on port 22, use the nmap script ssh-version as mentioned earlier. This script will provide more detailed information about the SSH version and configuration. Then, search for known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations related to the identified SSH version and configuration using a search engine or vulnerability database.1.
