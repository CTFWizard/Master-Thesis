   1.5 Identify vulnerabilities or interesting behaviour on the services - [to-do]
Task: Perform a full port scan

Step 1: Choose a port scanning tool
Select a port scanning tool that is suitable for your testing environment. Common tools include Nmap, Masscan, and Unicornscan.

Step 2: Install the port scanning tool (if necessary)
If you haven't installed the selected tool, do so using the appropriate package manager or installation method for your operating system.

Step 3: Run the full port scan
Open a terminal or command prompt and run the port scanning tool with the appropriate command to perform a full port scan on the target IP address. For example, using Nmap, you would run the following command:
```
nmap -p- -T4 <target_IP_address>
```
This command scans all ports (`-p-`) using a normal timing template (`-T4`) on the specified target IP address.

Step 4: Interpret the results
Once the port scan is complete, review the output to identify open ports and their corresponding services. This information will be useful for determining the purpose of each open port and identifying potential vulnerabilities.

Reason: Performing a full port scan is an essential step in the penetration testing process. It helps identify all open ports on the target system, which can then be further analyzed for potential vulnerabilities or interesting behavior.
