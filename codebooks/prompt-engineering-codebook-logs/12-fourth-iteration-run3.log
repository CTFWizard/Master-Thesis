The most favorable task is 2.1.2.1.1 Research SSH version vulnerabilities.

To perform this task, first research the SSH version (OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7) to identify any known vulnerabilities. Then, compile a list of potential exploits for the discovered vulnerabilities.

The other task is 1.3.1.1.1 Identify SSH service.

To perform this task, use a tool like netcat or nmap to connect to the SSH service on port 22/tcp and verify that the service is running. If the service is running, proceed to the next step in the PTT.

The user recommends focusing on the gRPC service, which is running on port 50051/tcp.

To perform this task, install the grpcurl tool on the attacker's machine and use it to interact with the gRPC service on the target machine to identify potential vulnerabilities.

The user suggests using the grpcurl tool to interact with the gRPC service.

To perform this task, use the grpcurl tool to send requests to the gRPC service on the target machine and analyze the responses for potential vulnerabilities.
