Task: 1.2.1 Scan for open ports

Description: Perform a scan to identify open ports on the target system.

Command: nmap -sS -sV -Pn <target_IP>

Reason: Scanning for open ports is the first step in determining the attack surface of the target system. It helps identify which services are running and potentially vulnerable.

Steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the command: `nmap -sS -sV -Pn <target_IP>` (replace `<target_IP>` with the actual IP address of the target system).
3. Press Enter to execute the command.
4. Wait for the scan to complete. The output will display the open ports and the services running on them.

Remember to replace `<target_IP>` with the actual IP address of the target system.

Example grpcurl commands:

1. List available services: `grpcurl -plaintext -import-metadata 10.10.11.214:50051 list`
2. Call a specific method: `grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"field1": "value1", "field2": "value2"}' 10.10.11.214:50051 service.method`

Remember to replace `10.10.11.214` with the actual IP address and adjust the service and method names accordingly.

Favorable sub-task: Investigate gRPC service on port 50051

To perform this task:

1. Download and install the grpcurl tool.
2. Use grpcurl to interact with the gRPC service on the target machine to gather more information about the target machine.

Note: The actual method of connecting to the gRPC service and interacting with it may vary depending on the specific implementation of the gRPC service on the target machine. It is recommended to research the gRPC service in question and determine the appropriate method
