I will continue to expand the PTT as more information becomes available.
Alright, let's break down the given task into detailed steps for the tester to perform.

1. Identify Open Ports and Services - (to-do)

Step 1: Perform a full port scan

1. Use nmap to scan the target IP (10.10.11.214) for open ports.

Command:
```
nmap -sS -p- 10.10.11.214
```

Explanation: This command will perform a TCP SYN scan (-sS) on all ports (p-) for the target IP (10.10.11.214).

Step 2: Determine the purpose of each open port

1. Use nmap scripts to identify the service version and operating system.

Command:
```
nmap -sV -O 10.10.11.214
```

Explanation: This command will use nmap's service detection (-sV) and operating system detection (-O) to identify the service version and operating system.

1. Cross-reference the service versions with known vulnerabilities.

Command:
```
searchsploit <service_name>
```

Explanation: Replace `<service_name>` with the service name found in the nmap scan results. This command will search the Exploit Database (searchsploit) for known vulnerabilities related to the service.

Step 3: Explore each potential service

1. Use telnet or netcat to connect to each open port and interact with the service.

Command:
```
telnet <target_IP> <open_port>
```

Explanation: Replace `<target_IP>` with the target IP (10.10.11.214) and `<open_port>` with the open port number. This command will establish a connection to the service using the telnet protocol.

Step 4: Identify vulnerabilities or interesting behaviour on the services

1. Use automated tools like Nikto, Burp Suite, or OWASP ZAP to scan for vulnerabilities.

Command:
```
nikto -h <target_IP>
```

Explanation: Replace `<target_IP>` with the target IP (10.10.11.214). This command will scan the target IP using Nikto for potential vulnerabilities.

1. Manually analyze the service behavior for any potential weaknesses.

Explanation: In this step, the tester should carefully analyze the service behavior, looking for any interesting or potentially vulnerable behavior. This may involve reviewing HTTP headers, server banners, and other service-specific information.
