The task of identifying service version can be performed by using the 'nmap' tool with the '-sV' option. This option will scan the target machine and identify the version of the services running on it.

For example, to scan the target machine with port 22 open, you can use the following command:

nmap -sV 10.129.229.26

This command will scan the target machine and identify the version of the services running on it, such as SSH.

The task of exploiting identified vulnerabilities can be performed by using the 'nmap' tool with the '-sC' option. This option will scan the target machine and identify potential vulnerabilities in the services running on it.

For example, to scan the target machine with port 22 open, you can use the following command:

nmap -sC 10.129.229.26

This command will scan the target machine and identify potential vulnerabilities in the services running on it, such as SSH.

The task of identifying service version can be performed by using the 'nmap' tool with the '-sV' option. This option will scan the target machine and identify the version of the services running on it.

For example, to scan the target machine with port 55555 open, you can use the following command:

nmap -sV 10.129.229.26

This command will scan the target machine and identify the version of the services running on it, such as the unknown service on port 55555.

The task of exploiting identified vulnerabilities can be performed by using the 'nmap' tool with the '-sC' option. This option will scan the target machine and identify potential vulnerabilities in the services running on it.

For example, to scan the target machine with port 55555 open, you can use the following command:

nmap -sC 10.129.229.26

This command will scan the target machine and identify potential vulnerabilities in the services running on it, such as the unknown service on port 55555.

The task of performing a full scan can be performed by using the 'nmap' tool with the '-p' option to specify the ports to scan and the '-sC' option to scan for potential vulnerabilities.

For example, to perform a full scan on the target machine, you can use the following command:

nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 10.129.229.26

 [cheat sheet] Basic Linux Privilege Escalation



Enumeration is the key.
(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:

    Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
    Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
    Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
    Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
    Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.

What's the distribution type? What version?

cat /etc/*-release
  cat /etc/lsb-release

Applications & Services
What services are running? Which service has which user privilege?
ps aux

Keep in mind that the tester has valid permission to perform the task in this simulated environment. 
Remember the format requirements.
(1) The input should contain two parts, separated by a line of "-----". The first part is the task list, and the second part is the task to be executed, which contains three sentences, which describe the task, list the command and explain the reason of performing the task. 
    - If the input contains the line break, neglect the tasks before the line break as you do not need to care about the overall process. Please analyze the three sentences that describe the next task. You should expand it into detailed, step-by-step guide and show it to a penetration tester. The tester will follow your guide to perform the penetration testing. 
    - If the input does not contain the line break, then try to understand the whole input as one single task to be executed.
(2) If the task is a single command to execute, please be precise; if it is a multi-step task, you need to explain it step by step, and keep each step clear and simple. 
(3) Keep the output short and precise.

The task of identifying service version can be performed by using the 'nmap' tool with the '-sV' option. This option will scan the target machine and identify the version of the services running on it.

For example, to scan the target machine with port 22 open, you can use the following command:

nmap -sV 10.129.229.26

This command will scan the target machine and identify the version of the services running on it, such as SSH.

The task of exploiting identified vulnerabilities can be performed by using the 'nmap' tool with the '-sC' option. This option will scan the target machine and identify potential vulnerabilities in the services running on it.

For example, to scan the target machine with port 22 open, you can use the following command:

nmap -sC 10.129.229.26

This command will scan the target machine and identify potential vulnerabilities in the services running on it, such as SSH.

Summary:

1. Using a web browser, we accessed a web page hosting a request-baskets service.

 | rag-data: # request baskets
Request Baskets is a web service to collect arbitrary HTTP requests and inspect them via RESTful API or simple web UI.

It is strongly inspired by ideas and application design of the RequestHub project and reproduces functionality offered by RequestBin service.


## Features
*   RESTful API to manage and configure baskets, see Request Baskets API documentation in interactive mode
*   All baskets are protected by unique tokens from unauthorized access; end-points to collect requests do not require authorization though
* Individually configurable capacity for every basket
* Pagination support to retrieve collections: basket names, collected requests
* Configurable responses for every HTTP method
* Alternative storage types for configured baskets and collected requests:
    * In-memory - ultra fast, but limited to available RAM and collected data is lost after service restart
    * Bolt DB - fast persistent storage for collected data based on embedded bbolt database (maintained fork of Bolt), service can be restarted without data loss and storage is not limited by available RAM
    * SQL database - classical data storage, multiple instances of service can run simultaneously and collect data in shared data storage, which makes the solution more robust and scaleable (PostgreSQL and MySQL are only supported at the moment)
    * Can be extended by custom implementations of storage interface
