A favorable sub-task to perform is 1.3 Explore service and identify vulnerabilties. This task involves using manual techniques or tools like nmap scripting engine (NSE) to explore services running on the target machine and identify potential vulnerabilities. This is an important step in the penetration testing process, as it helps to identify potential entry points for exploitation.

To perform this task, first, use nmap to scan the target machine and identify the open ports and services. Then, use the nmap scripting engine (NSE) or manual techniques to explore the identified services and identify potential vulnerabilities. | rag-data: # nmap

 [cheat sheet] Basic Linux Privilege Escalation



Enumeration is the key.
(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:

    Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
    Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
    Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
    Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
    Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.


Operating System
What's the distribution type? What version?
cat /etc/issue
cat /etc/*-release
  cat /etc/lsb-release
  cat /etc/redhat-release



What's the Kernel version? Is it 64-bit?
cat /proc/version   
uname -a
uname -mrs
rpm -q kernel
dmesg | grep Linux
ls /boot | grep vmlinuz-



What can be learnt from the environmental variables?
cat /etc/profile
cat /etc/bashrc
cat ~/.bash_profile
cat ~/.bashrc
cat ~/.bash_logout
env
set



Is there a printer?
lpstat -a



Applications & Services

    - If the input contains the line break, neglect the tasks before the line break as you do not need to care about the overall process. Please analyze the three sentences that describe the next task. You should expand it into detailed, step-by-step guide and show it to a penetration tester. The tester will follow your guide to perform the penetration testing. 
    - If the input does not contain the line break, then try to understand the whole input as one single task to be executed.
(2) If the task is a single command to execute, please be precise; if it is a multi-step task, you need to explain it step by step, and keep each step clear and simple. 
(3) Keep the output short and precise.

The tester's questions led to the addition of more specific tasks under the "Explore service and identify vulnerabilities" task. These tasks include using the nmap scripting engine (NSE) and manual techniques to explore services and identify vulnerabilities. Additionally, the tester's questions also led to the addition of tasks under the "Exploit vulnerabilities" task. These tasks include exploiting service vulnerabilities and exploiting web application vulnerabilities.1. Reconnaissance - [completed]

* 3.2 Find the root flag.txt - [to-do]

A favorable sub-task to perform is 1.3.1 Use nmap scripting engine (NSE). This task involves using the nmap scripting engine (NSE) to explore services running on the target machine and identify potential vulnerabilities. This is an important step in the penetration testing process, as it helps to identify potential entry points for exploitation.

To perform this task, first, use nmap to scan the target machine and identify the open ports and services. Then, use the nmap scripting engine (NSE) to explore the identified services and identify potential vulnerabilities.

Note that the usage of automated scanners such as Nexus, Nessus, and OpenVAS is NOT allowed. | rag-data: ides & Links

    Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
    Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
    Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
    Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
    Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.

The tester has discovered an unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability in Maltrail v0.54. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the target system without authentication.

The tester has added tasks to exploit this vulnerability for initial access. The following PTT is generated with the added tasks:

3. Privilege Escalation - [to-do]
    3.1 Run linpeas and linenum - [to-do]
    3.2 Find the root flag.txt - [to-do]

To perform the added sub-task 2.1.2.2 Exploit Maltrail v0.54 unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability, the following steps can be taken:

1. Use the nmap scripting engine (NSE) to explore the identified services and identify potential vulnerabilities in the Maltrail v0.54 web service.
2. Once the unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability is identified, exploit it by crafting a request that executes arbitrary OS commands on the target system.

Note that the usage of automated scanners such as Nexus, Nessus, and OpenVAS is NOT allowed.

The tester has also provided a list of resources for finding exploit code and more information regarding the exploit. These resources can be used to further explore the system and identify additional vulnerabilities.

A favorable sub-task to perform is 2.1.2.2 Exploit Maltrail v0.54 unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability. This task involves exploiting the unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability in the Maltrail v0.54 web service.

To perform this task, the following steps can be taken:

1. Use the nmap scripting engine (NSE) to explore the identified services and identify potential vulnerabilities in the Maltrail v0.54 web service.
2. Once the unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability is identified, exploit it by crafting a request that executes arbitrary OS commands on the target system.

 | rag-data: # nmap
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

## Usage: nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] {target specification}
## TARGET SPECIFICATION:
  Can pass hostnames, IP addresses, networks, etc.
  Ex: scanme.nmap.org, microsoft.com/24, 192.168.0.1; 10.0.0-255.1-254
  -iL <inputfilename>: Input from list of hosts/networks
  -iR <num hosts>: Choose random targets
  --exclude <host1[,host2][,host3],...>: Exclude hosts/networks
  --excludefile <exclude_file>: Exclude list from file
## HOST DISCOVERY:
  -sL: List Scan - simply list targets to scan
  -sn: Ping Scan - disable port scan
  -Pn: Treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery
  -PS/PA/PU/PY[portlist]: TCP SYN/ACK, UDP or SCTP discovery to given ports
  -PE/PP/PM: ICMP echo, timestamp, and netmask request discovery probes
  -PO[protocol list]: IP Protocol Ping
  -n/-R: Never do DNS resolution/Always resolve [default: sometimes]
  --dns-servers <serv1[,serv2],...>: Specify custom DNS servers
  --system-dns: Use OS's DNS resolver
  --traceroute: Trace hop path to each host
## SCAN TECHNIQUES:
  -sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
  -sU: UDP Scan
  -sN/sF/sX: TCP Null, FIN, and Xmas scans
  --scanflags <flags>: Customize TCP scan flags
  -sI <zombie host[:probeport]>: Idle scan
  -sY/sZ: SCTP INIT/COOKIE-ECHO scans
  -sO: IP protocol scan
  -b <FTP relay host>: FTP bounce scan
## PORT SPECIFICATION AND SCAN ORDER:
  -p <port ranges>: Only scan specified ports
