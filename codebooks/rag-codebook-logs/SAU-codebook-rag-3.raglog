 [cheat sheet] Basic Linux Privilege Escalation



Enumeration is the key.
(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:

    Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
    Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
    Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
    Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
    Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.


Operating System
What's the distribution type? What version?
cat /etc/issue
cat /etc/*-release
  cat /etc/lsb-release
  cat /etc/redhat-release



What's the Kernel version? Is it 64-bit?
cat /proc/version   
uname -a
uname -mrs
rpm -q kernel
dmesg | grep Linux
ls /boot | grep vmlinuz-



What can be learnt from the environmental variables?
cat /etc/profile
cat /etc/bashrc
cat ~/.bash_profile
cat ~/.bashrc
cat ~/.bash_logout
env
set



Is there a printer?
lpstat -a



Applications & Services
What services are running? Which service has which user privilege?
ps aux
ps -ef
top
cat /etc/service



Which service(s) are been running by root? Of these services, which are vulnerable - it's worth a double check!

The tasks are now more detailed and focused on specific actions, such as connecting to the SSH service and attempting to log in. This should help the tester better understand the tasks and make progress in the penetration testing process.1.1.1.1 Connect to the SSH service on port 22 using a suitable SSH client. - [to-do]

From the given PTT, the most favorable sub-task is "1.1.1.1 Connect to the SSH service on port 22 using a suitable SSH client. - [to-do]". To perform this task, we need to use a suitable SSH client, such as PuTTY or OpenSSH, and connect to the target IP address on port 22.

The second most favorable sub-task is "1.1.1.1.2 Attempt to log in with a valid user account. - [to-do]". To perform this task, we need to try to log in to the SSH service using a valid user account, such as the default user account "ubuntu" or any other user accounts that may be present on the system.

The third most favorable sub-task is "1.1.1.2 Port 55555 is open, with an unrecognized service. The tool returned the following fingerprint: - [to-do]". To perform this task, we should investigate the unrecognized service further, possibly by attempting to connect to it using a suitable client or by analyzing the fingerprint provided by the Nmap scan. | rag-data: ides & Links

The tasks related to SSH on port 22 are now marked as "not applicable" based on the tester's instructions. The focus is now on port 55555 and its unrecognized service.

The tester has discovered a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the service on port 55555, as indicated by CVE-2023-27163. This vulnerability can be exploited to access network resources and sensitive information via a crafted API request.

The tester should investigate this vulnerability further and attempt to exploit it to gain initial access to the target system.

The tester should also explore the service on port 55555 further, using the information provided by the RAG similarity search and the URI http://10.129.229.26:55555. This may lead to the discovery of additional vulnerabilities or useful information that can be used to further the penetration testing process.1.1.1.2 Port 55555 is open, with an unrecognized service.

From the given PTT, the most favorable sub-task is "1.1.1.2 Port 55555 is open, with an unrecognized service. The tool returned the following fingerprint: - [to-do]". To perform this task, we should investigate the unrecognized service further, possibly by attempting to connect to it using a suitable client or by analyzing the fingerprint provided by the Nmap scan.

The second most favorable sub-task is "1.1.1.2.1 Investigate the unrecognized service further, possibly by attempting to connect to it using a suitable client. - [to-do]". To perform this task, we need to use a suitable client, such as a web browser, to connect to the URI http://10.129.229.26:55555 and explore the service further.

The third most favorable sub-task is "1.1.1.2.2 Analyze the fingerprint provided by the Nmap scan. - [to-do]". To perform this task, we need to analyze the fingerprint provided by the Nmap scan to gain further insight into the unrecognized service on port 55555.

Based on the tester's instructions, we should also focus on the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, as indicated by CVE-2023-27163. This vulnerability can be exploited to access network resources and sensitive information via a crafted API request.

 [cheat sheet] Basic Linux Privilege Escalation



Enumeration is the key.
(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:

    Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
    Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
    Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
    Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
    Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.


Operating System
What's the distribution type? What version?
cat /etc/issue
cat /etc/*-release
  cat /etc/lsb-release
  cat /etc/redhat-release



What's the Kernel version? Is it 64-bit?
cat /proc/version   
uname -a
uname -mrs
rpm -q kernel
dmesg | grep Linux
ls /boot | grep vmlinuz-



What can be learnt from the environmental variables?
cat /etc/profile
cat /etc/bashrc
cat ~/.bash_profile
cat ~/.bashrc
cat ~/.bash_logout
env
set



Is there a printer?
lpstat -a



Applications & Services
What services are running? Which service has which user privilege?
ps aux
ps -ef
top
cat /etc/service



Which service(s) are been running by root? Of these services, which are vulnerable - it's worth a double check!

The tester should also consider the possibility of using the SSRF vulnerability to perform other types of attacks, such as denial of service (DoS) attacks or exfiltration of sensitive data.

The tester should also be aware of any potential countermeasures that the target system may have implemented to protect against SSRF attacks, such as input validation or firewall rules.

The tester should also be mindful of any potential legal or ethical implications of exploiting the SSRF vulnerability, and should ensure that any actions taken are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
