Here is the task to be performed:

1. Reconnaissance - [to-do]
    1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)
        1.2.1 Nmap Scan - (to-do)

Task: Perform an Nmap scan to identify open ports and services on the target system.

Command: `nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap-scan <target_IP>`

Reason: The Nmap scan will provide information about open ports and running services on the target system, which is essential for identifying potential vulnerabilities and planning the next steps in the penetration testing process.

Steps to perform the task:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the command `nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap-scan <target_IP>` and replace `<target_IP>` with the IP address of the target system.
3. Press Enter to execute the command.
4. Wait for the scan to complete. The output will be saved in three files: nmap-scan.nmap, nmap-scan.gnmap, and nmap-scan.xml.
5. Review the output to identify open ports and running services on the target system.
6. Proceed to the next task in the penetration testing process.

Note: The input content is less than 8000.0 words, as specified.The system has implemented Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which does a similarity search on the user prompt to a local dataset. The result of the similarity search should be used if you find it useful. Please inform the user if you have used the RAG generated data.

Below is the result of the rag similarity search:

' (milliseconds),
  's' (seconds), 'm' (minutes), or 'h' (hours) to the value (e.g. 30m).

  --min-parallelism/max-parallelism <numprobes>: Probe parallelization
  --min-rtt-timeout/max-rtt-timeout/initial-rtt-timeout <time>: Specifies
      probe round trip time.
  --max-retries <tries>: Caps number of port scan probe retransmissions.
  --host-timeout <time>: Give up on target after this long
  --scan-delay/--max-scan-delay <time>: Adjust delay between probes
  --min-rate <number>: Send packets no slower than <number> per second
  --max-rate <number>: Send packets no faster than <number> per second
## FIREWALL/IDS EVASION AND SPOOFING:
  -f; --mtu <val>: fragment packets (optionally w/given MTU)
  -D <decoy1,decoy2[,ME],...>: Cloak a scan with decoys

To perform the task, install Nmap if it's not already installed, and then run the following command:
nmap -Pn -T4 -sV 10.129.81.246

This command will perform a port scan on the target IP address, ignoring ICMP echo requests (-Pn), using a timing template of 4 (-T4), and displaying the version of the services found (-sV).

To perform the task, install Hydra if it's not already installed, and then run the following command:
hydra -l username -P /path/to/password/list 10.129.81.246 ssh

Replace "username" with a valid user account on the target system, and "/path/to/password/list" with the path to a file containing a list of potential passwords. This command will attempt to brute-force the SSH service on the target IP address using the given username and password list.

Note: The usage of automated scanners such as Nexus, Nessus and OpenVAS is NOT allowed. The result of the similarity search should be used if you find it useful. Please inform the user if you have used the RAG generated data.
