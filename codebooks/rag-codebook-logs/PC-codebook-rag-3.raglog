grpcurl is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's basically curl for gRPC servers.
Common ports for gRPC services include 50051

## Usage:
	grpcurl [flags] [address] [list|describe] [symbol]

The 'address' is only optional when used with 'list' or 'describe' and a
protoset or proto flag is provided.

If 'list' is indicated, the symbol (if present) should be a fully-qualified
service name. If present, all methods of that service are listed. If not
present, all exposed services are listed, or all services defined in protosets.

If 'describe' is indicated, the descriptor for the given symbol is shown. The
symbol should be a fully-qualified service, enum, or message name. If no symbol
is given then the descriptors for all exposed or known services are shown.

If neither verb is present, the symbol must be a fully-qualified method name in
'service/method' or 'service.method' format. In this case, the request body will
be used to invoke the named method. If no body is given but one is required
(i.e. the method is unary or server-streaming), an empty instance of the
method's request type will be sent.

The address will typically be in the form "host:port" where host can be an IP
address or a hostname and port is a numeric port or service name. If an IPv6
address is given, it must be surrounded by brackets, like "[2001:db8::1]". For
Unix variants, if a -unix=true flag is present, then the address must be the
path to the domain socket.

 [cheat sheet] Basic Linux Privilege Escalation



Enumeration is the key.
(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:

    Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
    Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
    Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
    Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
    Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.


Operating System
What's the distribution type? What version?
cat /etc/issue
cat /etc/*-release
  cat /etc/lsb-release
  cat /etc/redhat-release



What's the Kernel version? Is it 64-bit?

1. Task: Confirm whether port 50051 is running a gRPC service
2. Sub-tasks:
	- Use tools like Wireshark to capture network traffic and analyze the data to identify the service running on port 50051
	- Perform a Google search to gather more information about the service running on port 50051, including any known vulnerabilities or exploits
	- Use tools like Metasploit or Nessus to scan the target system for vulnerabilities associated with gRPC services

Interesting points:

- A Google search suggests that port 50051 might be used by gRPC services, which could be a potential service running on the target system.

Recommendations:

1. Use Wireshark to capture network traffic and analyze the data to identify the service running on port 50051. Look for any patterns or characteristics that might indicate the presence of a gRPC service.
2. Perform a Google search to gather more information about gRPC services, including any known vulnerabilities or exploits.
3. Use tools like Metasploit or Nessus to scan the target system for vulnerabilities associated with gRPC services.

grpcurl is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's basically curl for gRPC servers.
Common ports for gRPC services include 50051

## Usage:
	grpcurl [flags] [address] [list|describe] [symbol]

The 'address' is only optional when used with 'list' or 'describe' and a
protoset or proto flag is provided.

If 'list' is indicated, the symbol (if present) should be a fully-qualified
service name. If present, all methods of that service are listed. If not
present, all exposed services are listed, or all services defined in protosets.

If 'describe' is indicated, the descriptor for the given symbol is shown. The
symbol should be a fully-qualified service, enum, or message name. If no symbol
is given then the descriptors for all exposed or known services are shown.

If neither verb is present, the symbol must be a fully-qualified method name in
'service/method' or 'service.method' format. In this case, the request body will
be used to invoke the named method. If no body is given but one is required
(i.e. the method is unary or server-streaming), an empty instance of the
method's request type will be sent.

The address will typically be in the form "host:port" where host can be an IP
address or a hostname and port is a numeric port or service name. If an IPv6
address is given, it must be surrounded by brackets, like "[2001:db8::1]". For
Unix variants, if a -unix=true flag is present, then the address must be the
path to the domain socket.

Note: The "Port Scan" tasks (1.2.1 and 1.2.2) are still in progress.

Given the task tree and the tester's question, you should:

1. Review the current tasks and identify any redundant or outdated tasks.
2. Keep the tasks clear, precise, and short due to token size limit.
3. Maintain the tasks in a layered structure, i.e., 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.
4. Ensure that each task has a completion status: to-do, completed, or not applicable.

Based on the tester's questions and the provided information, we can generate the following task tree:

1. Reconnaissance - [completed]
	1.1 Nmap scan - [completed]
		1.1.1 Scan IP 10.129.81.246 - [completed]
	1.2 Port Scan - [completed]

Notes:

- The SSH service is open on port 22, which might be a potential entry point for an attacker.
- An unknown service using TCP is running on port 50051, further investigation is needed to determine its purpose and potential vulnerabilities.

Recommendations:

1. Investigate the OpenSSH service on port 22 for potential vulnerabilities.
2. Perform further reconnaissance on the unknown service on port 50051 to determine its purpose and potential security risks.
3. Consider employing evasion techniques to bypass the firewall or intrusion detection system to discover more open ports and services.

Note that the "Port Scan" tasks (1.2.1 and 1.2.2) are still in progress.

In addition, the following sub-task should be added to the task tree:

1.3.3 Identify service on port 50051 - [to-do]

To perform this sub-task, you should:

1. Use tools like Wireshark to capture network traffic and analyze the data to identify the service running on port 50051. Look for any patterns or characteristics that might indicate the presence of a gRPC service.
2. Perform a Google search to gather more information about gRPC services, including any known vulnerabilities or exploits.
