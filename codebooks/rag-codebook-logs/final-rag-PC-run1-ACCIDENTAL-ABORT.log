Alright, let's break down the task in the PTT.

The task is:

1.1.1 Identify open ports - (to-do)

To guide the tester through this task, we need to provide detailed steps.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Launch the terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command to perform a basic Nmap scan: `nmap <target_IP>`. Replace `<target_IP>` with the IP address of the target system.
3. Press Enter to execute the command.
4. The Nmap scan will now run, identifying open ports on the target system.
5. Once the scan is completed, Nmap will display the results, showing the open ports and their corresponding service versions.

Please follow these steps to identify open ports on the target system.

The most favorable sub-task is 1.2 Port Scan.

To perform a port scan, use the following command:

nmap -Pn -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 10.10.11.214

This command will scan all ports on the target IP and identify open ports.

After identifying open ports, further explore the services running on those ports to identify potential vulnerabilities.

To exploit the SSH service on port 22, use the following commands:

nmap -sV -p 22 10.10.11.214

This command will identify the SSH version and protocol in use.

Next, use the ssh2john tool to extract the SSH password hashes.

ssh2john -j 1 10.10.11.214

This command will extract the SSH password hashes from the SSH server.

Then, use John the Ripper to crack the SSH password hashes.

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes

This command will attempt to crack the SSH password hashes using the rockyou.txt wordlist. Once the password is cracked, use it to log into the SSH service on port 22.

ssh user@10.10.11.214

This command will log into the SSH service on port 22 using the cracked password.

After gaining access to the system, locate and capture the user flag.txt.

find / -name "user.txt" -print 2>/dev/null

This command will search for the user flag.txt file on the system.

cat /path/to/user.txt

This command will display the contents of the user flag.txt file.

Please note that the actual password and path to the user flag.txt file may vary depending on the specific configuration of the SSH service.

The SSH service on port 50051 is currently unknown. Further exploration of this service may be necessary to identify potential vulnerabilities.

The system has implemented Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which does a similarity search on the user prompt to a local dataset. The result of the similarity search should be used if you find it useful. Please inform the user if you have used the RAG generated data.

Below is the result of the rag similarity search:

The tester suggests focusing on the gRPC service running on port 50051. To further explore this service, use the following commands:

nmap -sV -p 50051 10.10.11.214

This command will identify the gRPC version and protocol in use.

Next, use the grpc_cli tool to interact with the gRPC service on port 50051.

grpc_cli list 10.10.11.214:50051

This command will list the available gRPC service methods on port 50051.

Then, use the grpc_cli tool to call the available service methods.

grpc_cli call 10.10.11.214:50051 <method_name> <method_args>

This command will call the specified gRPC service method on port 50051 with the provided arguments.

After gaining access to the system, locate and capture the user flag.txt.

find / -name "user.txt" -print 2>/dev/null

This command will search for the user flag.txt file on the system.

cat /path/to/user.txt

This command will display the contents of the user flag.txt file.

Please note that the actual path to the user flag.txt file may vary depending on the specific configuration of the gRPC service.

The SSH service on port 22 may still be worth exploring, as it is a common entry point for Linux systems.

The system has implemented Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which does a similarity search on the user prompt to a local dataset. The result of the similarity search should be used if you find it useful. Please inform the user if you have used the RAG generated data.

# grpcurl
grpcurl is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's basically curl for gRPC servers.
Common ports for gRPC services include 50051

## Usage:
	grpcurl [flags] [address] [list|describe] [symbol]

The 'address' is only optional when used with 'list' or 'describe' and a
protoset or proto flag is provided.

If 'list' is indicated, the symbol (if present) should be a fully-qualified
service name. If present, all methods of that service are listed. If not
present, all exposed services are listed, or all services defined in protosets.

If 'describe' is indicated, the descriptor for the given symbol is shown. The
symbol should be a fully-qualified service, enum, or message name. If no symbol
is given then the descriptors for all exposed or known services are shown.

If neither verb is present, the symbol must be a fully-qualified method name in
'service/method' or 'service.method' format. In this case, the request body will
be used to invoke the named method. If no body is given but one is required
(i.e. the method is unary or server-streaming), an empty instance of the
method's request type will be sent.

The address will typically be in the form "host:port" where host can be an IP
address or a hostname and port is a numeric port or service name. If an IPv6
address is given, it must be surrounded by brackets, like "[2001:db8::1]". For
Unix variants, if a -unix=true flag is present, then the address must be the
path to the domain socket.

## Example

The tester's suggestion to use the grpcurl tool is a valid approach, as it may provide a potential entry point into the system. However, it is important to continue exploring other services and vulnerabilities to increase the chances of successful exploitation.

The usage of grpcurl is demonstrated in the provided example, which can be adapted to interact with the gRPC service running on port 50051.1. Reconnaissance - [to-do]

grpcurl -plaintext 10.10.11.214:50051 describe SimpleApp   

SimpleApp is a service:
service SimpleApp {
  rpc LoginUser ( .LoginUserRequest ) returns ( .LoginUserResponse );
  rpc RegisterUser ( .RegisterUserRequest ) returns ( .RegisterUserResponse );
  rpc getInfo ( .getInfoRequest ) returns ( .getInfoResponse );
}

To further explore the gRPC service running on port 50051, use the following commands:

grpcurl -list 10.10.11.214:50051

This command will list the available gRPC service methods on port 50051.

Next, use the grpcurl tool to call the available service methods.

grpcurl -d '{"username": "user", "password": "password"}' 10.10.11.214:50051 LoginUser

This command will call the LoginUser method on port 50051 with the provided username and password.

Please note that the actual path to the user flag.txt file may vary depending on the specific configuration of the gRPC service.

The SSH service on port 22 may still be worth exploring, as it is a common entry point for Linux systems.

The system has implemented Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which does a similarity search on the user prompt to a local dataset. The result of the similarity search should be used if you find it useful. Please inform the user if you have used the RAG generated data.

Below is the result of the rag similarity search:

# grpcurl
grpcurl is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's basically curl for gRPC servers.
Common ports for gRPC services include 50051
