The task to be executed is:

1.3.1 Analyze HTTP/HTTPS services - (to-do)

Here are the detailed steps for the tester to perform:

1. Use a web browser or a tool like curl to access the HTTP/HTTPS services on the target system.
2. Observe the web pages and look for any potential vulnerabilities, such as outdated software versions, insecure configurations, or exposed sensitive data.
3. Use tools like Nikto, Burp Suite, or OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) to perform automated scans and identify vulnerabilities in the web applications.
4. Review the results of the automated scans and prioritize the potential vulnerabilities based on their severity and impact.
5. Manually verify the identified vulnerabilities to ensure their accuracy and avoid false positives.
6. Document the findings and potential exploits for each vulnerability.

Remember to follow the guidelines provided by the organization and ensure that you have valid permission to perform these tasks in the simulated environment.

The most favorable and most likely to lead to successful exploit sub-task is "2.1.1 Exploit web application vulnerabilities" as it is the only vulnerability exploration task available.

To perform this task, first identify the web application running on the target server. Then, analyze the application for any known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and file inclusion vulnerabilities. Finally, exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the target server.
