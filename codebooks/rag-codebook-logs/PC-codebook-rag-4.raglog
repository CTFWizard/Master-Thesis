grpcurl is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's basically curl for gRPC servers.
Common ports for gRPC services include 50051

## Usage:
	grpcurl [flags] [address] [list|describe] [symbol]

The 'address' is only optional when used with 'list' or 'describe' and a
protoset or proto flag is provided.

If 'list' is indicated, the symbol (if present) should be a fully-qualified
service name. If present, all methods of that service are listed. If not
present, all exposed services are listed, or all services defined in protosets.

If 'describe' is indicated, the descriptor for the given symbol is shown. The
symbol should be a fully-qualified service, enum, or message name. If no symbol
is given then the descriptors for all exposed or known services are shown.

If neither verb is present, the symbol must be a fully-qualified method name in
'service/method' or 'service.method' format. In this case, the request body will
be used to invoke the named method. If no body is given but one is required
(i.e. the method is unary or server-streaming), an empty instance of the
method's request type will be sent.

The address will typically be in the form "host:port" where host can be an IP
address or a hostname and port is a numeric port or service name. If an IPv6
address is given, it must be surrounded by brackets, like "[2001:db8::1]". For
Unix variants, if a -unix=true flag is present, then the address must be the
path to the domain socket.

Based on the tester's feedback, I have updated the PTT to explore the gRPC services to gain initial access.

1. grpc.reflection.v1alpha.ServerReflection service is discovered on 10.129.81.246:50051

Automated Enumeration Scripts:

    In real life we dont get much time to do enumeration so we can make use of some cool automated scripts like follows,

    LinEnum: https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum

    Linux Smart Enumeration: https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration
    Linux Priv Checker: https://github.com/linted/linuxprivchecker

Linux Kernel Exploits:

    After finding the version of Kernel simple google for that exploit or you can also use “Linux Exploit suggester”
    Once you find the exploit for the privesc, transfer the payload from your machine to target machine and execute and you’re good to go.
    In an example I worked out with overlayfs exploit and got higher privileges

Sudo:

    This one of the first step to do, when you get access to the machine just simpley run “sudo -l”, which lists all the files that we can run as root without any password
    Once you have any to run then navigate to https://gtfobins.github.io/ and search for is the one specified is a system program or else modify the file with “/bin/sh” and run that

 [cheat sheet] Basic Linux Privilege Escalation



Enumeration is the key.
(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:

    Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
    Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
    Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
    Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
    Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.


Operating System
What's the distribution type? What version?
cat /etc/issue
cat /etc/*-release
  cat /etc/lsb-release
  cat /etc/redhat-release



What's the Kernel version? Is it 64-bit?
cat /proc/version

What can be learnt from the environmental variables?

Is there a printer?

Using the commmand grpcurl -plaintext  10.129.81.246:50051 describe SimpleApp I got:
SimpleApp is a service:

  rpc RegisterUser ( .RegisterUserRequest ) returns ( .RegisterUserResponse );
  rpc getInfo ( .getInfoRequest ) returns ( .getInfoResponse );
}

What does this mean? | rag-data: # grpcurl
grpcurl is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's basically curl for gRPC servers.
Common ports for gRPC services include 50051

## Usage:
	grpcurl [flags] [address] [list|describe] [symbol]

The 'address' is only optional when used with 'list' or 'describe' and a
protoset or proto flag is provided.

If 'list' is indicated, the symbol (if present) should be a fully-qualified
service name. If present, all methods of that service are listed. If not
present, all exposed services are listed, or all services defined in protosets.

If 'describe' is indicated, the descriptor for the given symbol is shown. The
symbol should be a fully-qualified service, enum, or message name. If no symbol
is given then the descriptors for all exposed or known services are shown.

If neither verb is present, the symbol must be a fully-qualified method name in
'service/method' or 'service.method' format. In this case, the request body will
be used to invoke the named method. If no body is given but one is required
(i.e. the method is unary or server-streaming), an empty instance of the
method's request type will be sent.

The address will typically be in the form "host:port" where host can be an IP
address or a hostname and port is a numeric port or service name. If an IPv6
address is given, it must be surrounded by brackets, like "[2001:db8::1]". For
Unix variants, if a -unix=true flag is present, then the address must be the
path to the domain socket.

Please give your comments, and update the tasks if necessary.The SimpleApp service description reveals that it offers three Remote Procedure Call (RPC) methods: LoginUser, RegisterUser, and getInfo. Further investigation of these methods may uncover potential vulnerabilities or entry points for the penetration test.

Based on the tester's feedback, I have updated the PTT to explore the RPC methods offered by the SimpleApp service to gain initial access. The "Explore the gRPC service to gain initial access" task is now marked as "to-do", and a new task "Explore the RPC methods offered by the SimpleApp service to gain initial access" is added under "1.2 Explore service and identify vulnerabilities". The remaining tasks remain unchanged.

The tester has provided the following information:

1. SimpleApp service description
