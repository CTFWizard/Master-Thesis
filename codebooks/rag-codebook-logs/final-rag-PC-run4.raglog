 [cheat sheet] Basic Linux Privilege Escalation



Enumeration is the key.
(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:

    Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
    Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
    Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
    Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
    Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.

    3.2 Find the root flag.txt - [to-do]

The tester has questions and is unclear about the current test. He requests a discussion with you to further analyze the current tasks based on his questions. 

Please read the following inputs from the tester. Analyze the task and generate the task tree again based on the requirements:

1. The tester is wondering if there is a need to perform a more detailed port scan to identify other open ports on the target machine.
2. The tester is also concerned about the time it takes to perform the port scan. He is asking if there is a way to optimize the port scan process.
3. The tester is asking if there are any specific tools or techniques that can be used to identify vulnerabilities in the services running on the target machine.
4. The tester is also interested in knowing if there are any automated tools available that can help in the vulnerability identification process.

Based on the tester's questions, the revised PTT is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance - [completed]
    1.1 Enumerate open ports and services - [completed]
        1.1.1 Perform a more detailed port scan - [to-do]
        1.1.2 Optimize the port scan process - [to-do]

    3.2 Find the root flag.txt - [to-do]

Note that the completion status of 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 is based on the tester's questions. The completion status of other tasks will be updated as more information becomes available.1. Reconnaissance - [completed]

    3.2 Find the root flag.txt - [to-do]

Favorable sub-task: 1.1.1 Perform a more detailed port scan

To perform the task:

1. Use a more detailed port scan tool like nmap to scan the target machine for all ports.
2. Analyze the results to identify any additional open ports or services on the target machine.

Note: The usage of automated scanners such as Nexus, Nessus and OpenVAS is NOT allowed.

2. The user's findings can be useful for further penetration testing and potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the gRPC service. | rag-data: # grpcurl
grpcurl is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's basically curl for gRPC servers.
Common ports for gRPC services include 50051

## Usage:
	grpcurl [flags] [address] [list|describe] [symbol]

The 'address' is only optional when used with 'list' or 'describe' and a
protoset or proto flag is provided.

If 'list' is indicated, the symbol (if present) should be a fully-qualified
service name. If present, all methods of that service are listed. If not
present, all exposed services are listed, or all services defined in protosets.

If 'describe' is indicated, the descriptor for the given symbol is shown. The
symbol should be a fully-qualified service, enum, or message name. If no symbol
is given then the descriptors for all exposed or known services are shown.

If neither verb is present, the symbol must be a fully-qualified method name in
'service/method' or 'service.method' format. In this case, the request body will
be used to invoke the named method. If no body is given but one is required
(i.e. the method is unary or server-streaming), an empty instance of the
method's request type will be sent.

The address will typically be in the form "host:port" where host can be an IP
address or a hostname and port is a numeric port or service name. If an IPv6
address is given, it must be surrounded by brackets, like "[2001:db8::1]". For
Unix variants, if a -unix=true flag is present, then the address must be the
path to the domain socket.
