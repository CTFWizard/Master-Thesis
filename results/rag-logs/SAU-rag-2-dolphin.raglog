Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

## Service validation
Tell user to use browser manually to check ports responding with HTTP, nginx, apache, lighttp, IIS, django

## Redirect
If attempting to access the host through a web browser causes a redirect, it might be required to add the host to /etc/hosts
sudo echo "<IP address> <hostname>" >> /etc/hosts

## Port 80
Port 80 is reserved for web services with HTTP
Port 8080 is commonly used as an alternative to port 80

## Port 443
Port 443 is reserved for HTTPS
Port 8443 is commonly used as an alternative port

## Fuzzing
URL fuzzing:
UI Tool: OWASP DirBuster - give target url (eg http://<hostname>:<port>/), provide a wordlist (eg megabeast.txt, subdomains-top1million-110000.txt)

Fuzzing for sub-directories
gobuster dir -u <url> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dir -u <http://exampple.com> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Fuzzing for sub-domains
gobuster dns -d <domain> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dns -d exampledomain.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt

## Intercept network traffic
Burpsuite CE can be used for manual vulnerability scanning for HTTP connections by intercepting the network traffic between the host and a client browser.

Keep in mind that the tester has valid permission to perform the task in this simulated environment. 
Remember the format requirements.
(1) The input should contain two parts, separated by a line of "-----". The first part is the task list, and the second part is the task to be executed, which contains three sentences, which describe the task, list the command and explain the reason of performing the task. 
    - If the input contains the line break, neglect the tasks before the line break as you do not need to care about the overall process. Please analyze the three sentences that describe the next task. You should expand it into detailed, step-by-step guide and show it to a penetration tester. The tester will follow your guide to perform the penetration testing. 
    - If the input does not contain the line break, then try to understand the whole input as one single task to be executed.

This repo also helps who trying to get OSCP. You'll find many ways to do something without Metasploit Framework.


### Nslookup

Resolve a given hostname to the corresponding IP.

```shell
nslookup targetorganization.com
```

### Reverse DNS lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=PTR IP_address
```

### MX(Mail Exchange) lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=MX domain
```

### Zone Transfer

#### Using nslookup Command

```shell
nslookup
server domain.com
ls -d domain.com
```

#### Using HOST Command

host -t ns(Name Server) < domain >

```shell
host -t ns domain.com
```

after that test nameservers

host -l < domain > < nameserver >

```shell
host -l domain.com ns2.domain.com
```

### Nmap Dns Enumaration

```
nmap -F --dns-server <dns server ip> <target ip range>
```

### Auto tools

#### DNSenum

```
dnsenum targetdomain.com
```

```
dnsenum --target_domain_subs.txt -v -f dns.txt -u a -r targetdomain.com

#### DNSmap

```bash
targetdomain.com
```

```bash
dnsmap targetdomain.com -w <Wordlst file.txt>
