1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

Please note that this is the initial PTT and can be expanded as the penetration testing progresses.

In this task, we will focus on investigating the service running on the open ports.

To perform this task, follow these steps:
1. Use the "nmap -O" command to scan the target IP and identify the operating system running on the target machine.
2. Use the "nmap -sT" command to perform a TCP connect scan on the open ports to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
3. Research the identified services on the open ports to gather information about their vulnerabilities and exploits.
4. Based on the gathered information, choose an exploit that seems most likely to lead to successful exploitation.
5. Attempt to exploit the vulnerability and gain access to the target system.

Remember, this task should be attempted only after the prior tasks have been completed.

This repo has a collection of snippets of codes and commands to help our lives!
The main purpose is not be a crutch, this is a way to do not waste our precious time!
This repo also helps who trying to get OSCP. You'll find many ways to do something without Metasploit Framework.


### Nslookup

Resolve a given hostname to the corresponding IP.

```shell
nslookup targetorganization.com
```

### Reverse DNS lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=PTR IP_address
```

### MX(Mail Exchange) lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=MX domain
```

### Zone Transfer

#### Using nslookup Command

```shell
nslookup
server domain.com
ls -d domain.com
```

#### Using HOST Command

host -t ns(Name Server) < domain >

```shell
host -t ns domain.com
```

after that test nameservers

host -l < domain > < nameserver >

```shell
host -l domain.com ns2.domain.com
```

### Nmap Dns Enumaration

```
nmap -F --dns-server <dns server ip> <target ip range>
```

### Auto tools

#### DNSenum

```
dnsenum targetdomain.com
```

```
dnsenum --target_domain_subs.txt -v -f dns.txt -u a -r targetdomain.com
```

#### DNSmap

```bash
targetdomain.com
```

```bash
dnsmap targetdomain.com -w <Wordlst file.txt>
```

Brute Force, the file is saved in /tmp

```bash
dnsmap targetdom
