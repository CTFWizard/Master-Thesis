   3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)
Task: 1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)

Guidance:

1. Use a port scanner tool, such as Nmap, to scan the target system for open ports.
2. Run the following command in the terminal: `nmap -sS -p- <target_IP>`
3. The `-sS` flag tells Nmap to perform a TCP SYN scan, which is a stealthy scan that doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake.
4. The `-p-` flag tells Nmap to scan all ports (from 1 to 65535).
5. Replace `<target_IP>` with the IP address of the target system.

Reason:

Performing a port scan is an essential step in the penetration testing process. It helps identify open ports on the target system, which can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access. By scanning all ports, you can ensure that no potentially vulnerable ports are overlooked.
