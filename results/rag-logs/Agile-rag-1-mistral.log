Regarding the web app on port 80:

1. Use a browser to manually check if the ports are responding with HTTP, nginx, apache, lighttp, IIS, or Django.
2. If attempting to access the host through a web browser causes a redirect, add the host to the /etc/hosts file.
3. Check if the port 80 is reserved for web services with HTTP, and port 8080 is an alternative port.
4. Check if the port 443 is reserved for HTTPS, and port 8443 is an alternative port.
5. Perform URL fuzzing using OWASP DirBuster or Gobuster tool for directories and subdomains.
6. Use Burpsuite CE to intercept network traffic between the host and client browser for manual vulnerability scanning.
7. Keep in mind the RAG generated data and inform the user if you have used it.
