   3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)
Task: 1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)
Command: nmap -sV -p- 192.168.1.1
Reason: To identify open ports on the target IP address (192.168.1.1) and list the services running on those ports.

Step-by-step guide:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the command: `nmap -sV -p- 192.168.1.1`
3. Press Enter to execute the command.

This will initiate a comprehensive port scan on the target IP address (192.168.1.1) using the nmap tool. The `-sV` flag specifies that nmap should perform a version scan, which will help identify the services running on open ports. The `-p-` flag tells nmap to scan all ports (1-65535) on the target IP address.

Once the scan is completed, you will see a list of open ports and the services running on those ports. This information will be useful for the next steps in the penetration testing process, such as identifying potential vulnerabilities and exploiting them to gain access to the target system.

# nmap
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends TCP packets with no flags set (NULL scan), which can help identify certain firewall rules or misconfigurations.
   ```
   nmap -sN <target-ip>
   ```

8. **TCP FIN Scan**:
   - This scan sends TCP packets with the FIN flag set, which can help identify certain firewall rules or misconfigurations.
   ```

   ```

9. **TCP Xmas Scan**:
   - This scan sends TCP packets with the FIN, PSH, and URG flags set, which can help identify certain firewall rules or misconfigurations.
   ```
   nmap -sX <target-ip>
   ```

10. **Custom Ports Scan**:
    - This scan allows you to specify a list of ports to scan, rather than scanning all ports.
    ```
    nmap -p <port1,port2,port3,...> <target-ip>
    ```

11. **Script Scanning**:
    - This scan uses Nmap's built-in scripting engine to execute scripts that can perform various tasks, such as detecting vulnerabilities, exploiting weaknesses, or gathering additional information about the target.
    ```
    nmap --script <script-name> <target-ip>
    ```

12. **Service Version Detection**:

    ```

13. **Traceroute**:
    - This scan uses the traceroute technique to trace the path from the source to the target, providing information about the network hops along the way.
    ```
    nmap -traceroute <target-ip>
    ```

14. **Timing and Performance Options**:
    - Nmap has various timing and performance options that allow you to adjust the speed and thoroughness of the scan.
    ```
    nmap --scan-delay <time> --max-rtt-timeout <time> --min-rtt-timeout <time> --initial-rtt-timeout <time> --max-retries <number> <target-ip>

   - This task involves
You can follow the instructions below to complete the tasks.Apologies for the confusion. I will provide guidance on the given task and break it down into detailed steps for the tester to perform.

Task: 2.1 Investigate the SSH service - (to-do)
Command: nmap -sV <target-ip>
Reason: To investigate the SSH service running on the target IP address (192.168.1.1) and identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

Step-by-step guide:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the command: `nmap -sV <target-ip>`
3. Press Enter to execute the command.

This will initiate a version scan on the target IP address (192.168.1.1) using the nmap tool. The `-sV` flag specifies that nmap should perform a version scan, which will help identify the services running on the target machine, including the SSH service.

Once the scan is completed, you will see a list of open ports and the services running on those ports. Look for the SSH service (usually port 22) in the output. If the SSH service is detected, you can proceed to the next steps to further investigate the service.

If you have any questions or need further guidance, please let me know.

You can follow the instructions below to complete the tasks.Apologies for the confusion. I will provide guidance on the given task and break it down into detailed steps for the tester to perform.

Task: 2.1 Investigate the SSH service - (to-do)
Command: nmap -sV <target-ip>
Reason: To investigate the SSH service running on the target IP address (192.168.1.1) and identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

Step-by-step guide:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the command: `nmap -sV <target-ip>`
3. Press Enter to execute the command.

This will initiate a version scan on the target IP address (192.168.1.1) using the nmap tool. The `-sV` flag specifies that nmap should perform a version scan, which will help identify the services running on the target machine, including the SSH service.

Once the scan is completed, you will see a list of open ports and the services running on those ports. Look for the SSH service (usually port 22) in the output. If the SSH service is detected, you can proceed to the next steps to further investigate the service.

If you have any questions or need further guidance, please let me know.
