   3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)

Please note that this is the initial PTT and will be expanded as the penetration testing process progresses.

 Task 1.2: Port Scan

1.2.1: Perform a port scan on the target network using a tool such as Nmap.
- Use the command "nmap -sV -T4 [target IP address]" to scan for open ports and identify the services running on them.

1.2.2: Identify open ports and their associated services.
- Analyze the Nmap scan results to determine which ports are open and the services associated with them.

1.2.3: Search the Internet for services defaulting to the open ports.
- Use online resources, such as Shodan or Censys, to search for devices defaulting to the open ports found in the scan results.

Task 2.1: Investigate the service

2.1.1: Gather information about the service, including its version, vulnerabilities, and common attack vectors.
- Use online resources, such as vulnerability databases or service-specific forums, to research the service and its known vulnerabilities.

2.1.2: Identify any potential attack vectors or exploits targeting the service.
- Analyze the gathered information to determine any potential attack vectors or exploits that can be used to gain access to the service.

Task 3.1: Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1

3.1.1: Perform a port scan on the localhost (127.0.0.1) using a tool such as Nmap.
- Use the command "nmap -sV -T4 127.0.0.1" to scan for open ports and identify the services running on them.

3.1.2: Identify open ports and their associated services on the localhost.
- Analyze the Nmap scan results to determine which ports are open and the services associated with them.

3.1.3: Search for files that the current user runs as root.
- Use tools like 'sudo -l' or 'ps auxww' to find any files that the current user runs with root privileges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_prompt: Discuss | We know the service on port 80 is the website http://jupiter.htb
How should we go about investigating and find ways to gain access the the web server?
response:  To investigate and gain access to the web server on port 80, follow these steps:

1. Gather information about the web server:
   - Use online resources, such as vulnerability databases or service-specific forums, to research the web server and its known vulnerabilities.
   - Identify common attack vectors or exploits that can be used to gain access to the web server.

2. Perform a port scan on the web server:
   - Use a tool such as Nmap to scan for open ports and identify the services running on them.
   - Analyze the Nmap scan results to determine which ports are open and the services associated with them.

3. Fuzzing for sub-directories and sub-domains:
   - Use tools like Gobuster to fuzz for sub-directories and sub-domains.
   - This can help identify additional directories or sub-domains that might contain valuable information or vulnerabilities.

4. Intercept network traffic:
   - Use a tool such as Burpsuite CE to intercept network traffic between the web server and a client browser.
   - This can help identify potential vulnerabilities or exploits that can be used to gain access to the web server.

5. Analyze the gathered information:
   - Review the information collected from the previous steps to determine potential vulnerabilities or exploits that can be used to gain access to the web server.

6. Exploit the vulnerability:
   - Once a vulnerability or exploit is identified, attempt to exploit it to gain access to the web server.

7. Privilege escalation:
   - If access is gained to the web server, perform privilege escalation techniques to gain higher-level access to the system.

Please note that the PTT will be expanded as the penetration testing process progresses, and the next tasks will be provided accordingly.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_prompt: Discuss | How can I go about using gobuster to fuzz http://jupiter.htb for sum-domains and sub-directories? Can you generate the commands?
response:  To use Gobuster to fuzz http://jupiter.htb for sub-domains and sub-directories, follow these steps:

1. Install Gobuster: If you haven't already, install Gobuster using the command "sudo pip install gobuster" on a Linux system or "sudo easy_install gobuster" on a Windows system.

2. Update Gobuster: Before using Gobuster, ensure that you have the latest wordlists by running the command "gobuster -update" on a Linux system or "gobuster -update" on a Windows system.

3. Fuzzing for sub-domains:
   - To fuzz for sub-domains, use the command "gobuster dns -d jupiter.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt" on a Linux system or "gobuster dns -d jupiter.htb -w C:\usr\share\wordlists\subdomains-top1million-110000.txt" on a Windows system.

4. Fuzzing for sub-directories:
   - To fuzz for sub-directories, use the command "gobuster dir -u http://jupiter.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt" on a Linux system or "gobuster dir -u http://jupiter.htb -w C:\usr\share\wordlists\dirb\common.txt" on a Windows system.

Found: [Status=200] [Length=34390] [Word=kiosk] http://kiosk.jupiter.htb
response:  To use FFUF to fuzz http://jupiter.htb for sub-domains, follow these steps:

1. Install FFUF: If you haven't already, install FFUF using the command "go get -u github.com/ffuf/ffuf" on a Linux system or "go get -u github.com/ffuf/ffuf" on a Windows system.

2. Update FFUF: Before using FFUF, ensure that you have the latest wordlists by running the command "go get -u github.com/ffuf/ffuf/wordlists" on a Linux system or "go get -u github.com/ffuf/ffuz/wordlists" on a Windows system.

3. Fuzzing for sub-domains:
   - To fuzz for sub-domains, use the command "ffuf -u http://jupiter.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -mc 200,301,302,403" on a Linux system or "ffuf -u http://jupiter.htb -w C:\usr\share\wordlists\subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -mc 200,301,302,403" on a Windows system.
