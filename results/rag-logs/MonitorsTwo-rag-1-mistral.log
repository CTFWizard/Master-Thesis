 Based on the given input, the task to be performed is "Privilege Escalation - (skipped)". However, since the task is skipped, there is no need to provide detailed steps for it. Instead, focus on the next task, which is "Port Scan - (to-do)".

Here is the detailed step guide for "Port Scan - (to-do)":

1. Choose a port scanning tool, such as Nmap, which is a popular and versatile tool for network exploration and security auditing.

2. Start by running a SYN scan using Nmap. A SYN scan is a stealthy scan that sends a partial TCP connection request to the target system, which helps to identify open ports without alerting the target system.

3. Use the following command to initiate the SYN scan:
```
nmap -sS -Pn -p- [target_ip]
```
Replace [target_ip] with the target system's IP address.

4. Analyze the results of the port scan, which will show you the open ports on the target system.

5. Identify any open ports that may be associated with potential security vulnerabilities, such as open ports defaulting to well-known services.

6. Document your findings, including the open ports and their associated services, as well as any vulnerabilities or risks associated with them.

7. If necessary, perform additional scans or tests to gather more information about the target system and its vulnerabilities.

8. Report your findings to the appropriate stakeholders, including recommendations for remediation and improvement of the target system's security posture.

# Nmap
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

7. If necessary, perform additional scans or tests to gather more information about the target system and its vulnerabilities.

8. Report your findings to the appropriate stakeholders, including recommendations for remediation and improvement of the target system's security posture.

In addition to the above steps, you can also try the following methods to investigate the service on port 80:

1. Use a web browser to manually check if the host is accessible through port 80 by entering the hostname or IP address in the browser's address bar.

2. If the host is not accessible through port 80, consider adding the host to the /etc/hosts file with the appropriate IP address and hostname. For example:
```
sudo echo "<IP address> <hostname>" >> /etc/hosts
```

3. Check for any port redirection by attempting to access the host through a web browser. If a redirect occurs, it may be necessary to add the host to the /etc/hosts file as mentioned above.

4. Investigate port 8080, which is a common alternative port for web services. If port 80 is not accessible, try scanning for port 8080 and check for web services running on that port.

5. Use tools like OWASP DirBuster and Gobuster to perform URL fuzzing and sub-domain enumeration. These tools can help identify potential vulnerabilities and sub-domains on the host.

6. Intercept network traffic using a tool like Burpsuite CE to manually scan for HTTP connections and vulnerabilities.

7. Perform additional scans and tests to gather more information about the target system and its vulnerabilities, such as using network analysis tools and performing web application scans.
