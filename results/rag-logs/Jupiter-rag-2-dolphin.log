Task: 1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)

Step 1: Install necessary tools
Before starting the port scan, ensure that you have the required tools installed on your system. One popular tool for port scanning is nmap. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [https://nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html).

Step 2: Start the port scan
Once you have nmap installed, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where nmap is installed. Then, use the following command to start the port scan on the target IP address (10.10.11.216):
```
nmap -sS -Pn <target_ip>
```
Replace `<target_ip>` with the actual target IP address (10.10.11.216).

Step 3: Interpret the results
After running the command, nmap will display the open ports on the target IP address. Take note of these open ports, as they will be used in the next steps of the penetration testing process.

Task: 1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)

Step 1: Review the port scan results
From the previous step, you should have the list of open ports on the target IP address. Take note of these ports, as they will be used in the next steps of the penetration testing process.

Step 2: Research the services associated with the open ports
For each open port, use a search engine like Google to find out more information about the service associated with that port. This will help you understand the potential vulnerabilities and exploits that may be available for that service.

Task: 1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)

Step 1: Use a search engine to find default credentials
For each open port, search for the default credentials or default configuration for the service associated with that port. This information can be found on the service's official website, forums, or other online resources.

Step 2: Test the default credentials
Once you have the default credentials or default configuration, try to use them to access the service on the target IP address. If the credentials are correct, you will gain initial access to the target system.

Task: 2.1 Investigate the service - (to-do)

Step 1: Use the open ports to identify the services running on the target IP address
From the port scan results, you should have the list of open ports on the target IP address. Use this information to identify the services running on the target IP address.

Step 2: Research the services to find potential vulnerabilities
For each service running on the target IP address, use a search engine like Google to find potential vulnerabilities or exploits that may be available for that service. This information can be found on the service's official website, forums, or other online resources.

Task: 3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1 - (to-do)

Step 1: Start the port scan on the local network
Use the following command to start the port scan on the local network (127.0.0.1):
```
nmap -sS -Pn 127.0.0.1
```

Step 2: Interpret the results
After running the command, nmap will display the open ports on the local network. Take note of these open ports, as they may be useful for further penetration testing.

Task: 3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)

Step 1: Use the "sudo -l" command to find files the current user can run as root
Use the following command to list the files that the current user can run as root:
```
sudo -l
```

Step 2: Review the output
The output of the "sudo -l" command will show the files that the current user can run as root. Take note of these files, as they may be useful for further penetration testing.

Remember to follow the guidelines provided in the input and format your output accordingly. Keep your instructions clear and concise, providing step-by-step guidance for the tester to follow.

user_prompt: Brainstorm | Lets focus on the webapp at port 80
response: Task: Investigate the web application at port 80

Step 1: Use a web browser to manually check the ports responding with HTTP
Access the web application at port 80 using a web browser to verify that it is responding with HTTP.

Step 2: Check the web server version
Identify the web server software and version by examining the HTTP response headers or the server's banner.

Step 3: Perform service validation
Validate the service by attempting to access the host through a web browser and checking if it responds with the expected HTTP status code.

Step 4: Add the host to /etc/hosts if necessary
If attempting to access the host through a web browser causes a redirect, it might be required to add the host to /etc/hosts. Use the following command to add the host:
```
sudo echo "<IP address> <hostname>" >> /etc/hosts
```

Step 5: Fuzz the URL for potential directories and files
Use a tool like OWASP DirBuster to fuzz the URL for potential directories and files. Provide the target URL (e.g., http://<hostname>:<port>/), and a wordlist (e.g., megabeast.txt, subdomains-top1million-110000.txt).

Step 6: Fuzz for sub-directories
Use a tool like gobuster to fuzz for sub-directories. Provide the URL (e.g., http://<hostname>:<port>/), and a wordlist (e.g., /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt).

Step 7: Fuzz for sub-domains
Use a tool like gobuster to fuzz for sub-domains. Provide the domain (e.g., exampledomain.com), and a wordlist (e.g., /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt).

Step 8: Intercept network traffic using Burpsuite CE
Use Burpsuite CE to intercept the network traffic between the host and a client browser. This will allow for manual vulnerability scanning of the HTTP connections.

Remember to follow the guidelines provided in the input and format your output accordingly. Keep your instructions clear and concise, providing step-by-step guidance for the tester to follow.
