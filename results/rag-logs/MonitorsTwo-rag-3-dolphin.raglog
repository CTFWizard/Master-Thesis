Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

2. Resulted in a cacti version 1.2.22 web page | rag-data: # HTTP


## Service validation
Tell user to use browser manually to check ports responding with HTTP, nginx, apache, lighttp, IIS, django

## Redirect
If attempting to access the host through a web browser causes a redirect, it might be required to add the host to /etc/hosts
sudo echo "<IP address> <hostname>" >> /etc/hosts

## Port 80
Port 80 is reserved for web services with HTTP
Port 8080 is commonly used as an alternative to port 80

## Port 443
Port 443 is reserved for HTTPS
Port 8443 is commonly used as an alternative port

## Fuzzing
URL fuzzing:
UI Tool: OWASP DirBuster - give target url (eg http://<hostname>:<port>/), provide a wordlist (eg megabeast.txt, subdomains-top1million-110000.txt)

Fuzzing for sub-directories
gobuster dir -u <url> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dir -u <http://example.com> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Fuzzing for sub-domains
gobuster dns -d <domain> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dns -d exampledomain.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt

## Intercept network traffic
Burpsuite CE can be used for manual vulnerability scanning for HTTP connections by intercepting the network traffic between the host and a client browser.
