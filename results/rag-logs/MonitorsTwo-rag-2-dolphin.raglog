Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

The task "Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)" is favorable and most likely to lead to successful exploit. To perform this task, use the following steps:

1. Open a terminal window on the attacker's machine.
2. Enter the command "nmap -A <target-ip>" and press Enter, replacing "<target-ip>" with the IP address of the target machine (10.10.11.211).

This will perform an aggressive scan on the target machine, providing detailed information about its operating system, open ports, and services running on those ports.

The task "OS Detection" is the best task to perform after the "Port Scan" task. To perform this task, use the following steps:

1. Open a terminal window on the attacker's machine.
2. Enter the command "nmap -O <target-ip>" and press Enter, replacing "<target-ip>" with the IP address of the target machine (10.10.11.211).

This will perform an OS detection scan on the target machine, providing information about the operating system type and version. | rag-data: <p align="center">
