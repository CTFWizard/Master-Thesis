Step 2: In the search bar, type the port number you found in the previous step (1.3 Identify Open Ports) and click the "Search" button.

Step 3: Review the search results to find any default services associated with the port number.

Step 4: Take note of the default services, as this information may be useful for further testing.

Task: 2.1 Investigate the service - (to-do)

Step 1: Use the "nmap" command with the appropriate options to scan the target IP address and gather more information about the open ports and services.

```
nmap -A <target-ip>
```

Explanation: The `-A` option enables aggressive scan mode, which includes OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute. This helps to gather detailed information about the target system and its services.

Task: 3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1 - (to-do)

Step 1: Use the "nmap" command with the appropriate options to scan the local network for open ports and services.

```
nmap -sP <target-ip>
```

Explanation: The `-sP` option enables a ping scan, which checks if the target IP address is online. This helps to identify the presence of other devices on the local network.

Task: 3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)

Step 1: Use the "sudo" command to run the "find" command as the root user and search for files with the setuid bit set.

```
sudo find / -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null
```

Explanation: The `sudo` command allows you to run the `find` command with root privileges. The `/` argument tells `find` to search the entire filesystem. The `-user root` option limits the search to files owned by the root user. The `-perm -4000` option finds files with the setuid bit set, which can potentially be exploited for privilege escalation. The `-print` option prints the results, and the `2>/dev/null` redirects error messages to the null device, preventing them from appearing on the screen.

Remember to follow the tester's instructions and use the appropriate tools and resources to perform the tasks.

user_prompt: Discuss | Opening the 10.129.228.212 on port 80 in  a web browser causes a redirect to the web page http://superpass.htb
How should we investigate this web page?
response: Based on the findings and questions from the tester, I will provide a detailed analysis and potential answers to the questions.

1. The tester discovered an open port running an HTTP service on the target IP address, which redirects to the web page http://superpass.htb.

To investigate this web page, the tester should perform the following steps:

a. Use a web browser to manually check ports responding with HTTP, nginx, apache, lighttp, IIS, and Django. This will help to identify the specific web server software running on the target IP address.

b. If attempting to access the host through a web browser causes a redirect, it might be required to add the host to /etc/hosts. This can be done using the following command:

```
sudo echo "<IP address> <hostname>" >> /etc/hosts
```

c. Use a tool like Gobuster to perform directory and subdomain fuzzing. This will help to discover hidden directories and subdomains that may contain valuable information or potential vulnerabilities.

2. The system has implemented Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which does a similarity search on the user prompt to a local dataset. The result of the similarity search is as follows:

```
# HTTP

## Service validation
Tell user to use browser manually to check ports responding with HTTP, nginx, apache, lighttp, IIS, django

## Redirect
If attempting to access the host through a web browser causes a redirect, it might be required to add the host to /etc/hosts
sudo echo "<IP address> <hostname>" >> /etc/hosts

## Port 80
Port 80 is reserved for web services with HTTP
Port 8080 is commonly used as an alternative to port 80

## Port 443
Port 443 is reserved for HTTPS
Port 8443 is commonly used as an alternative port

## Fuzzing
URL fuzzing:
UI Tool: OWASP DirBuster - give target url (eg http://<hostname>:<port>/), provide a wordlist (eg megabeast.txt, subdomains-top1million-110000.txt)

Fuzzing for sub-directories
gobuster dir -u <url> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dir -u <http://example.com> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Fuzzing for sub-domains
gobuster dns -d <domain> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dns -d exampledomain.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt

## Intercept network traffic
Burpsuite CE can be used for manual vulnerability scanning for HTTP connections by intercepting the network traffic between the host and a client browser.
```

The RAG similarity search result provides valuable information on how to investigate the web page and perform various security testing techniques.

3. The tester should use a tool like Burp Suite CE to intercept network traffic between the target IP address and a client browser. This will help to identify any potential vulnerabilities in the HTTP service, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or other application-layer vulnerabilities.

Remember to follow the tester's instructions and use the appropriate tools and resources to perform the tasks.

response: Based on the findings and questions from the tester, I will provide a detailed analysis and potential answers to the questions.

1. The tester discovered the following directories using Gobuster:

```
/download             (Status: 302) [Size: 249] [--> /account/login?next=%2Fdownload]
/static               (Status: 301) [Size: 178] [--> http://superpass.htb/static/]
/vault                (Status: 302) [Size: 243] [--> /account/login?next=%2Fvault]
```

To further investigate these directories, the tester should perform the following steps:

a. Access each directory using a web browser to see if any valuable information or potential vulnerabilities are present.

b. Use a tool like Burp Suite CE to intercept network traffic between the target IP address and a client browser while accessing these directories. This will help to identify any potential vulnerabilities in the HTTP service, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or other application-layer vulnerabilities.

Connection: close
```

To further investigate this HTTP request, the tester should perform the following steps:

a. Modify the HTTP request in Burp Suite to change the value of the "fn" parameter in the URL. This will help to discover any potential vulnerabilities related to file inclusion or other application-layer vulnerabilities.

b. Use a tool like FFUF to perform additional directory and file fuzzing on the target IP address. This will help to discover hidden directories and files that may contain valuable information or potential vulnerabilities.

Remember to follow the tester's instructions and use the appropriate tools and resources to perform the tasks.

To answer the tester's question about some known files on Linux machines that can be set as the "fn" parameter value, here are a few examples:

1. /etc/passwd: This file contains a list of user accounts on the system.
2. /etc/shadow: This file contains the encrypted passwords for user accounts on the system.
3. /etc/group: This file contains a list of groups on the system.
4. /home/user/documents: This is an example of a user's home directory and a subdirectory containing documents.
5. /usr/bin/ls: This is an example of a system binary that could be executed if the application is susceptible to command injection vulnerabilities.

Remember to follow the tester's instructions and use the appropriate tools and resources to perform the tasks.

# nmap
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends TCP packets with the SYN, FIN, RST, PSH, and URG flags all set to 0.
   ```
   nmap -sN <target-ip>
   ```

8. **TCP FIN Scan**:
   - This scan sends TCP packets with the FIN flag set, attempting to determine whether the port is open or closed.
   ```
   nmap -sF <target-ip>
   ```

9. **TCP Xmas Tree Scan**:
   - This scan sends TCP packets with the FIN, PSH, and URG flags all set, attempting to determine whether the port is open or closed.
   ```
   nmap -sX <target-ip>
   ```

10. **TCP ACK Scan**:
   - This scan sends TCP packets with the ACK flag set, attempting to determine whether the port is open or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sA <target-ip>
   ```

11. **TCP Window Scan**:
   - This scan measures the TCP window size to determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sW <target-ip>
   ```

12. **TCP Maimon Scan**:
   - This scan sends a single TCP packet with the FIN and PSH flags set, attempting to determine whether the port is open or closed.
   ```
   nmap -sM <target-ip>
   ```

13. **IP ID Sequence Generation Detection**:
   - This scan analyzes the IP ID sequence generation for possible patterns, which can be used to identify the operating system.
   ```
   nmap -sI <target-ip>
   ```

14. **Version Detection**:
   - This scan attempts to determine the version of the services running on the target machine by sending probes and analyzing the responses.
   ```
   nmap -sV <target-ip>
   ```

15. **Script Scanning**:
   - This scan executes a set of custom scripts to perform additional tasks such as discovering service vulnerabilities or running exploits.
   ```
   nmap -sC <target-ip>
   ```

16. **Traceroute**:
   - This scan performs a traceroute to the target machine, showing the path taken by the packets to reach the target.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

From the given PTT, the following tasks are favorable and most likely to lead to successful exploit:

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```

# nmap
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends TCP packets with the SYN, FIN, RST, PSH, and URG flags all set to 0.
   ```
   nmap -sN <target-ip>
   ```

8. **TCP FIN Scan**:
   - This scan sends TCP packets with the FIN flag set, attempting to determine whether the port is open or closed.
   ```
   nmap -sF <target-ip>
   ```

9. **TCP Xmas Tree Scan**:
   - This scan sends TCP packets with the FIN, PSH, and URG flags all set, attempting to determine whether the port is open or closed.
   ```
   nmap -sX <target-ip>
   ```

10. **TCP ACK Scan**:
   - This scan sends TCP packets with the ACK flag set, attempting to determine whether the port is open or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sA <target-ip>
   ```

11. **TCP Window Scan**:
   - This scan measures the TCP window size to determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sW <target-ip>
   ```

12. **TCP Maimon Scan**:
   - This scan sends a single TCP packet with the FIN and PSH flags set, attempting to determine whether the port is open or closed.
   ```
   nmap -sM <target-ip>
   ```

13. **IP ID Sequence Generation Detection**:
   - This scan analyzes the IP ID sequence generation for possible patterns, which can be used to identify the operating system.
   ```
   nmap -sI <target-ip>
   ```

14. **Version Detection**:
   - This scan attempts to determine the version of the services running on the target machine by sending probes and analyzing the responses.
   ```
   nmap -sV <target-ip>
   ```

15. **Script Scanning**:
   - This scan executes a set of custom scripts to perform additional tasks such as discovering service vulnerabilities or running exploits.
   ```
   nmap -sC <target-ip>
   ```
