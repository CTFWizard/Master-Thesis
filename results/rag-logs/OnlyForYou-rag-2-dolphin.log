# nmap
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T
1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:

The most favorable sub-task in the list is "Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)". This task combines multiple techniques to provide detailed information about the target, including its operating system, open ports, and running services. This comprehensive scan can help identify potential vulnerabilities and exploits that can be used for successful exploitation.

To perform this task, use the following command:
```
nmap -A <target-ip>
```
Replace `<target-ip>` with the IP address of the target machine. This command will initiate a comprehensive scan on the target IP using Nmap's -A option, which combines OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to gather detailed information about the target. The results of this scan can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities and exploits that can be used for successful exploitation.

user_prompt: User ran more command.
response: Task: 2.1 Investigate the service

Task Description:
1. Use the `nmap` command with the `-sV` option to identify the version of the services running on the target IP address.
2. Execute the following command: `nmap -sV <target-ip>`
3. This command will perform a version detection scan on the target IP address to identify the version of the services running on the open ports.

Reason:
The purpose of this task is to gather more detailed information about the services running on the target system, specifically their version numbers. This information is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities and exploits that can be used for successful exploitation.

Note: This task is a follow-up to the previous task, which involved performing an aggressive scan on the target IP address. The version detection scan will be performed on the same target IP address, using the information gathered from the aggressive scan.

user_prompt: Brainstorm | Lets investigate port 80
response: Task: 2.1 Investigate the service

Task Description:
1. Use the `nmap` command with the `-sV` option to identify the version of the services running on the target IP address.
2. Execute the following command: `nmap -sV <target-ip>`
3. This command will perform a version detection scan on the target IP address to identify the version of the services running on the open ports.

Reason:
The purpose of this task is to gather more detailed information about the services running on the target system, specifically their version numbers. This information is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities and exploits that can be used for successful exploitation.

Note: This task is a follow-up to the previous task, which involved performing an aggressive scan on the target IP address. The version detection scan will be performed on the same target IP address, using the information gathered from the aggressive scan.

Results:
The Nmap scan revealed that the target host (10.10.11.210) has two open ports: port 22 (SSH service) and port 80 (HTTP service). The version detection scan should be performed on these ports to gather more detailed information about the services running on them.

To perform this task, use the following command:
```
nmap -sV <target-ip>
```
Replace `<target-ip>` with the IP address of the target machine. This command will initiate a version detection scan on the target IP using Nmap's `-sV` option, which will identify the version of the services running on the open ports. The results of this scan can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities and exploits that can be used for successful exploitation.

Additional Guidance:

1. Service Validation:
Manually check the ports responding with HTTP, nginx, apache, lighttp, IIS, django using a browser.

2. Redirect:
If attempting to access the host through a web browser causes a redirect, it might be required to add the host to /etc/hosts.
```
sudo echo "<IP address> <hostname>" >> /etc/hosts
```

3. Port 80:
Port 80 is reserved for web services with HTTP. Port 8080 is commonly used as an alternative to port 80.

4. Port 443:
Port 443 is reserved for HTTPS. Port 8443 is commonly used as an alternative port.

5. Fuzzing:
URL fuzzing:
* UI Tool: OWASP DirBuster - provide the target URL (e.g., http://<hostname>:<port>/), and a wordlist (e.g., megabeast.txt, subdomains-top1million-110000.txt).

Fuzzing for sub-directories:
* `gobuster dir -u <url> -w <wordlist>`
* `gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

Fuzzing for sub-domains:
* `gobuster dns -d <domain> -w <wordlist>`
* `gobuster dns -d exampledomain.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt`

6. Intercept Network Traffic:
Burpsuite CE can be used for manual vulnerability scanning for HTTP connections by intercepting the network traffic between the host and a client browser.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_prompt: Discuss | Can you give me more subdomains scan commands?
response: To perform subdomain scans, you can use the following commands:

1. Using `dnsrecon`:
```bash
dnsrecon -d TARGET -D /usr/share/wordlists/dnsmap.txt -t std --xml ouput.xml
```
This command will perform a DNS brute force scan on the target domain using the provided wordlist.

2. Using `fierce.pl`:
```bash
fierce -dns TARGET
```
This command will perform a DNS brute force scan on the target domain using the default wordlist.

3. Using `hostmap.rb`:
```bash
hostmap.rb -only-passive -t <IP>
```
This command will perform a DNS brute force scan on the target IP address using only passive information.

You can also use the `-with-zonetransfer` or `-bruteforce-level` options with `hostmap.rb` to perform a more aggressive scan.

4. Using `subbrute`:
```bash
subbrute -v -d TARGET
```
This command will perform a DNS brute force scan on the target domain using the default wordlist.

5. Using `amass`:
```bash
amass enum -d TARGET
```
This command will perform a DNS brute force scan on the target domain using the default wordlist.

Remember that you should analyze the findings and questions from the tester and provide potential answers to the questions. Be precise, thorough, and show your reasoning step by step.
