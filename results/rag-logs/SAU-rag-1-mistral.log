If i visit the basket i can now see the filtered http app at port 80. It is an instance of Maltrail (v0.53)
response:  Based on the given penetration testing tasks and the successful exploit, I will analyze the results and provide a step-by-step guide for the tester to proceed.

Step 1: Analyze the results
- The exploit was successful in creating a proxy basket on the Request-Baskets service, allowing the attacker to access resources on other servers.
- The attacker has access to the filtered http app instance of Maltrail (v0.53) on the localhost port 80.

Step 2: Investigate the potential impact
- The SSRF vulnerability could lead to information disclosure and other potential security issues, as the attacker can access resources on other servers.

Step 3: Recommend mitigations
