1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:

### Nslookup

Resolve a given hostname to the corresponding IP.

```shell
nslookup targetorganization.com
```

### Reverse DNS lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=PTR IP_address
```

### MX(Mail Exchange) lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=MX domain
```

### Zone Transfer

#### Using nslookup Command

```shell
nslookup
server domain.com
ls -d domain.com
```

#### Using HOST Command

host -t ns(Name Server) < domain >

```shell
host -t ns domain.com
```

after that test nameservers

host -l < domain > < nameserver >

```shell
host -l domain.com ns2.domain.com
```

### Nmap Dns Enumaration

```
nmap -F --dns-server <dns server ip> <target ip range>
```

### Auto tools

#### DNSenum

```
dnsenum targetdomain.com
```

```
dnsenum --target_domain_subs.txt -v -f dns.txt -u a -r targetdomain.com
```

#### DNSmap

```bash
targetdomain.com
```

```bash
dnsmap targetdomain.com -w <Wordlst file.txt>

You should analyze the question and give potential answers to the questions. Please be precise, thorough, and show your reasoning step by step. 

Opening the 10.129.228.212 on port 80 in  a web browser causes a redirect to the web page http://superpass.htb
How should we investigate this web page? | rag-data: # HTTP


## Service validation
Tell user to use browser manually to check ports responding with HTTP, nginx, apache, lighttp, IIS, django

## Redirect
If attempting to access the host through a web browser causes a redirect, it might be required to add the host to /etc/hosts
sudo echo "<IP address> <hostname>" >> /etc/hosts

## Port 80
Port 80 is reserved for web services with HTTP
Port 8080 is commonly used as an alternative to port 80

## Port 443
Port 443 is reserved for HTTPS
Port 8443 is commonly used as an alternative port

## Fuzzing
URL fuzzing:
UI Tool: OWASP DirBuster - give target url (eg http://<hostname>:<port>/), provide a wordlist (eg megabeast.txt, subdomains-top1million-110000.txt)

Fuzzing for sub-directories
gobuster dir -u <url> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dir -u <http://example.com> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Fuzzing for sub-domains
gobuster dns -d <domain> -w <wordlist>
gobuster dns -d exampledomain.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt

## Intercept network traffic
Burpsuite CE can be used for manual vulnerability scanning for HTTP connections by intercepting the network traffic between the host and a client browser.

FFUF (Fuzz Faster U Fool) is a fast web fuzzer written in Go, designed to help in quickly discovering potential vulnerabilities in web applications by performing brute force attacks on various parts of a web application.

Examples:

1. Basic usage:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ

2. Add custom header:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

3. Use POST method:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/api -X POST -d "param1=value1&param2=value2"

4. Finding subdomain:
ffuf -u https://FUZZ.example.com -w wordlist.txt -mc 200,301,302,403

5. Follow redirects:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -r

6. Use a proxy:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -p http://127.0.0.1:8080

7. Exclude directories:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -exclude-dirs "admin,backup,test"

8. Use custom match string:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -c "Password incorrect"

9. Number of threads:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -t 50

FFUF (Fuzz Faster U Fool) is a fast web fuzzer written in Go, designed to help in quickly discovering potential vulnerabilities in web applications by performing brute force attacks on various parts of a web application.

Examples:

1. Basic usage:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ

2. Add custom header:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

3. Use POST method:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/api -X POST -d "param1=value1&param2=value2"

4. Finding subdomain:
ffuf -u https://FUZZ.example.com -w wordlist.txt -mc 200,301,302,403

5. Follow redirects:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -r

6. Use a proxy:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -p http://127.0.0.1:8080

7. Exclude directories:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -exclude-dirs "admin,backup,test"

8. Use custom match string:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -c "Password incorrect"

9. Number of threads:

## XSS

### Reflected

#### Simple test

This is a simple test to see what happens, this is not a prove that the field is vuln to xss

```javascript
<plaintext>
```

#### Simple XSS test

```javascript
<script>alert('Found')</script>
```

```javascript
"><script>alert(Found)</script>">
```

```javascript
<script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>
```

#### Bypass filter of tag script

`"  onload="alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))`

```javascript
" onload="alert('XSS')
```

bla is not a valid image, so this cause an error

### Nslookup

Resolve a given hostname to the corresponding IP.

```shell
nslookup targetorganization.com
```

### Reverse DNS lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=PTR IP_address
```

### MX(Mail Exchange) lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=MX domain
```

### Zone Transfer

#### Using nslookup Command

```shell
nslookup
server domain.com
ls -d domain.com
```

#### Using HOST Command

host -t ns(Name Server) < domain >

```shell
host -t ns domain.com
```

after that test nameservers

host -l < domain > < nameserver >

```shell
host -l domain.com ns2.domain.com
```

### Nmap Dns Enumaration

```
nmap -F --dns-server <dns server ip> <target ip range>
```

### Auto tools

#### DNSenum

```
dnsenum targetdomain.com
```

```
dnsenum --target_domain_subs.txt -v -f dns.txt -u a -r targetdomain.com
```

#### DNSmap

```bash
targetdomain.com
```

```bash
dnsmap targetdomain.com -w <Wordlst file.txt>
```
