Task: 1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)

Task Description:
Perform a port scan on the target system to identify open ports and services.

Command:
nmap -sS -sV -p- <target_IP>

Reason:
A port scan is a necessary step in the penetration testing process to discover potential entry points and identify services running on the target system. The nmap command is a widely used tool for port scanning, and the options used in this command perform a TCP SYN scan (-sS), retrieve version information from the open ports (-sV), and scan all ports (-p-).

Steps to perform the task:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.
2. Type the following command, replacing <target_IP> with the IP address of the target system you want to scan:

nmap -sS -sV -p- <target_IP>

3. Press Enter to execute the command.
4. Wait for the scan to complete. The output will display the open ports and the services running on them.
5. Review the results carefully to identify any potential entry points or vulnerabilities that may be exploited during the penetration testing process.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A 10.129.228.231
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O 10.129.228.231
   ```

   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn 10.129.228.231
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS 10.129.228.231
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT 10.129.228.231
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.

The tester provides the following thoughts for your consideration. Please give your comments, and update the tasks if necessary.

The tester mentions that the SSH service is running on port 22. The tester wants to know if there are any known vulnerabilities in the SSH service.

The new task generated from the tester's thoughts is:

1. Research known vulnerabilities in the SSH service.

The task "Research known vulnerabilities in the SSH service" is now added to the PTT.

1. Reconnaissance - (completed)
  1.1 Passive Information Gathering - (completed)
  1.2 Port Scan - (completed)
    1.3 Identify Open Ports - (completed)
    1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)
2. Initial Access - (completed)
  2.1 Investigate the service - (completed)
3. Privile1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A 10.129.228.231
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O 10.129.228.231
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn 10.129.228.231
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS 10.129.228.231
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT 10.129.228.231
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU 10.129.228.231
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

The task that is most favorable and most likely to lead to a successful exploit is the "Research known vulnerabilities in the SSH service".

To perform this task, use the following steps:

1. Open a web browser.
2. Type "http://10.129.228.231" and press Enter.

This will access the host on port 80, which resulted in a cacti version 1.2.22 web page.
