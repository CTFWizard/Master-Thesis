Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

1. Mark task 1.2 and 1.3 as complete
2. Researching the internet reveals that port 50051 is often used for gRPC
3. Generate a task 1.4 to confirm this

Task 1.2 and 1.3 are marked as complete.

Port 50051 is often used for gRPC, as found during internet research.

Task 1.4: Confirm that port 50051 is used for gRPC. | rag-data: # grpcurl
grpcurl is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's basically curl for gRPC servers.
Common ports for gRPC services include 50051

## Example commands:
### grpcurl -plaintext -vv <ip:port> list
	Use this for initial scan of the gRPC API.
	Outputs a list of available services at the given address:port.
	-plaintext flag says to not use TLS when connecting.

### grpcurl -plaintext -vv <ip:port> list <Service>
	Use this to gather information about a service provided by the gRPC API.
	Outputs a list of available methods for the given service.
	-plaintext flag says to not use TSL when connecting.

### grpcurl -plaintext -vv <ip:port> describe <Service>
	Outputs the available methods for the given service with each methods input parameters and expected output.
	-plaintext flag says to not use TSL when connecting.

### grpcurl -plaintext -vv -format text -d '<input string>' <ip:port> <Service.Method>
	Submits data to the given service.method endpoint.
	-plaintext flag says to not use TSL when connecting.
	-format text flag tells the given input data is in a text format.
	-d '<input string>' flag tells what data to submit.
