user_prompt: I have a Linux hack the box machine. The target IP is 10.129.205.116
response: 1. Reconnaissance - (to-do)
  1.1 Passive Information Gathering - (complete)
  1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)
    1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)
    1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)
2. Initial Access - (to-do)
  2.1 Investigate the service - (to-do)
3. Privilege Escalation - (to-do)
   3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1 - (to-do)
   3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)
Task: 1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)

Detailed Steps:

1. Use the `nmap` command to scan the target IP address for open ports. For example, if the target IP address is `192.168.1.100`, you can use the following command:
```
nmap -sS 192.168.1.100
```
1. This command will perform a TCP SYN scan on the specified IP address. The `-sS` flag tells `nmap` to perform a TCP SYN scan, which is a stealthy scan that does not complete the TCP three-way handshake.
1. The output of the `nmap` scan will show you the open ports on the target IP address. Look for the ports that are listed as "open" or "filtered". These are the ports that you should investigate further.

Task: 1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)

Detailed Steps:

1. Use a search engine like Google to search for the default services that run on the open ports you identified in the previous step. For example, if you found that port 80 is open on the target IP address, you can search for "default services on port 80".
1. Look for any known vulnerabilities or exploits related to the identified services. This information can be found on various security websites, forums, and exploit databases.
1. Make a note of any relevant vulnerabilities or exploits that you find, as this information will be useful for the next steps of the penetration testing process.

Task: 2.1 Investigate the service - (to-do)

Detailed Steps:

1. Use a tool like `nmap` or `curl` to gather more information about the service running on the open port. For example, if port 80 is open and you suspect that a web server is running, you can use the following command to gather more information:
```
nmap -sV 192.168.1.100 -p 80
```
1. This command will perform a version scan on port 80 of the target IP address. The `-sV` flag tells `nmap` to try to identify the service version.
1. The output of the `nmap` scan will show you the service version running on the open port. Look for any known vulnerabilities or exploits related to the identified service version.

Task: 3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1 - (to-do)

Detailed Steps:

1. Use a tool like `nmap` to scan the local network for open ports. For example, if you are on a Linux system, you can use the following command to scan the local network:
```
nmap -sS 127.0.0.1
```
1. This command will perform a TCP SYN scan on the local network. The `-sS` flag tells `nmap` to perform a TCP SYN scan, which is a stealthy scan that does not complete the TCP three-way handshake.
1. The output of the `nmap` scan will show you the open ports on the local network. Look for the ports that are listed as "open" or "filtered". These are the ports that you should investigate further.

Task: 3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)

Detailed Steps:

1. Use a tool like `sudo -l` to list the files that the current user can run with root privileges. For example, if you are on a Linux system, you can use the following command:
```
sudo -l
```
1. This command will list the files that the current user can run with root privileges. Look for any files that are setuid or setgid to root. These files may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain root privileges.
1. Make a note of any relevant files that you find, as this information will be useful for the next steps of the penetration testing process.

# nmap
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

# nmap
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

The possible todo tasks are:

1. Nmap scan for 10.129.205.116
2. Host is up with latency of 0.026s
3. 65533 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
4. Port 22/tcp is open, service is SSH (OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7)
5. Port 50051/tcp is open, service is unknown

The most favorable and likely to lead to successful exploit task is:

1. Nmap scan for 10.129.205.116

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Type the command "nmap -A 10.129.205.116" and press Enter.

This will initiate an aggressive scan on the target IP address, providing detailed information about the open ports and the services running on them.

Note that the usage of automated scanners such as Nexus, Nessus and OpenVAS is NOT allowed.

The new information is:

1. Host is up with latency of 0.026s
2. 65533 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
