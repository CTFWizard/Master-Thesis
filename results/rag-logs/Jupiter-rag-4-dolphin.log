Task: 1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)

Task Explanation:
The tester needs to identify the open ports on the target system. This will help in understanding the services running on the system and potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

Task Details:

1. Use the command `nmap -sS <target_IP>` to perform a TCP SYN scan on the target IP address. This will identify open ports and the services running on them.

Reason:

A TCP SYN scan is a common and stealthy method for identifying open ports. It sends a SYN packet to each port on the target system and waits for a response. If a response is received, the port is considered open. This method is less likely to be detected by intrusion detection systems compared to other port scan methods.

Remember to replace `<target_IP>` with the actual IP address of the target system.

You can follow the instructions below to complete the tasks.Task: 2.1 Investigate the service - (to-do)

Task Explanation:
The tester needs to investigate the services running on the target system, specifically the SSH service on port 22 and the HTTP service on port 80. This will help in understanding the potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

Task Details:

1. Use the command `nmap -sV <target_IP>` to perform a version scan on the target IP address. This will identify the specific version of the services running on the target system.

Reason:

A version scan is useful for identifying the specific version of the services running on the target system. This information can be used to search for known vulnerabilities associated with those versions.

Remember to replace `<target_IP>` with the actual IP address of the target system.

Once the version scan is completed, the tester should proceed to the next task, which is to scan for files that the current user runs as root.

Task Explanation:
The tester needs to scan the local network for any open ports that can be exploited to gain access to the target system.

Task Details:

1. Use the command `nmap -sS 127.0.0.1` to perform a TCP SYN scan on the local network IP address 127.0.0.1. This will identify any open ports that can be exploited.

Reason:

A TCP SYN scan is a common and stealthy method for identifying open ports. It sends a SYN packet to each port on the target system and waits for a response. If a response is received, the port is considered open. This method is less likely to be detected by intrusion detection systems compared to other port scan methods.

Remember to replace `127.0.0.1` with the actual IP address of the local network interface.

Once the scan is completed, the tester should proceed to the next task, which is to scan for files that the current user runs as root.
