Possible todo tasks:

1. Perform an Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute) on the target IP.
```
nmap -A <target-ip>
```

2. Perform an OS Detection scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -O <target-ip>
```

3. Perform a TCP SYN Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sS <target-ip>
```

4. Perform a TCP Connect Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sT <target-ip>
```

5. Perform a UDP Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sU <target-ip>
```

6. Perform a TCP NULL Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sN <target-ip>
```

7. Perform a TCP FIN Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sF <target-ip>
```

8. Perform a TCP XMAS Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sX <target-ip>
```

9. Perform a TCP ACK Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sA <target-ip>
```

10. Perform a TCP Window Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sW <target-ip>
```

11. Perform a TCP Maimon Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sM <target-ip>
```

12. Perform an IPID Sequence Generation Detection scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sI <target-ip>
```

13. Perform a Version Detection scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sV <target-ip>
```

14. Perform a Script Scanning scan on the target IP.
```
nmap --script=<script-name> <target-ip>
```

15. Perform a Traceroute scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sT <target-ip>
```

16. Perform a Service Enumeration scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sV <target-ip>
```

17. Perform an OS Fingerprinting scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -O <target-ip>
```

18. Perform a Custom Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -scanflags <flag-name> <target-ip>
```

Considering the tester's questions, the "Port Scan" task is not necessary if the "Aggressive Scan" has already been performed. The tester can proceed with the "Initial Access" task by investigating the services on the open ports.

The "Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1" task is not applicable in this scenario, as the tester is already connected to the target machine.

The most favorable task to perform next is the "Service Enumeration" scan, which focuses on identifying the specific services running on the target machine's open ports. This can help the tester gather more information about the target and potentially identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

To perform the "Service Enumeration" scan, the tester should use the following command:
```
nmap -sV <target-ip>
```

This command will provide detailed information about the services running on the target machine's open ports, which can be useful for identifying potential vulnerabilities. | rag-data: <p align="center">

### Nslookup

Resolve a given hostname to the corresponding IP.

```shell
nslookup targetorganization.com
```

### Reverse DNS lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=PTR IP_address
```

### MX(Mail Exchange) lookup

```shell
nslookup -type=MX domain
```

### Zone Transfer

#### Using nslookup Command

```shell
nslookup
server domain.com
ls -d domain.com
```

#### Using HOST Command

host -t ns(Name Server) < domain >

```shell
host -t ns domain.com
```

after that test nameservers

host -l < domain > < nameserver >

```shell
host -l domain.com ns2.domain.com
```

### Nmap Dns Enumaration

```
nmap -F --dns-server <dns server ip> <target ip range>
```

### Auto tools

#### DNSenum

```
dnsenum targetdomain.com
```

```
dnsenum --target_domain_subs.txt -v -f dns.txt -u a -r targetdomain.com
```

#### DNSmap

```bash
targetdomain.com
```

```bash
dnsmap targetdomain.com -w <Wordlst file.txt>
```

Brute Force, the file is saved in /tmp

```bash
dnsmap targetdom

Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

Possible todo tasks:

1. Perform an Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute) on the target IP.
```
nmap -A <target-ip>
```

2. Perform an OS Detection scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -O <target-ip>
```

3. Perform a TCP SYN Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sS <target-ip>
```

4. Perform a TCP Connect Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sT <target-ip>
```

5. Perform a UDP Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sU <target-ip>
```

6. Perform a TCP NULL Scan on the target IP.
```
nmap -sN <target-ip>
```

Considering the tester's questions, the "Port Scan" task is not necessary if the "Aggressive Scan" has already been performed. The tester can proceed with the "Initial Access" task by investigating the services on the open ports.

The "Service Enumeration" scan has already been performed, and the tester has gathered information about the services running on the target machine's open ports.

Next, the tester should generate a query for searching the web to identify services on the open ports.

  1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)
