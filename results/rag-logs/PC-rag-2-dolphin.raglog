Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T

FFUF (Fuzz Faster U Fool) is a fast web fuzzer written in Go, designed to help in quickly discovering potential vulnerabilities in web applications by performing brute force attacks on various parts of a web application.

Examples:

1. Basic usage:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ

2. Add custom header:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

3. Use POST method:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/api -X POST -d "param1=value1&param2=value2"

4. Finding subdomain:
ffuf -u https://FUZZ.example.com -w wordlist.txt -mc 200,301,302,403

5. Follow redirects:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -r

6. Use a proxy:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -p http://127.0.0.1:8080

7. Exclude directories:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -exclude-dirs "admin,backup,test"

8. Use custom match string:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -c "Password incorrect"

9. Number of threads:
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -t 50
