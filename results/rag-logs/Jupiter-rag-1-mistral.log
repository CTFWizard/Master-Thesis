Investigating the HTTP service on port 80:
1. Manually access the host through a web browser to check if it responds with HTTP, nginx, apache, lighttpd, or IIS.
2. If a redirect occurs, add the host to /etc/hosts by using the command: sudo echo "<IP address> <hostname>" >> /etc/hosts
3. Check if port 80 is open and responding with HTTP. If not, try port 8080, which is a common alternative.
4. Check if port 443 is open and responding with HTTPS. If not, try port 8443, which is a common alternative.
5. Use URL fuzzing tools like OWASP DirBuster and gobuster to identify sub-directories and sub-domains.
6. Intercept network traffic using Burpsuite CE to manually scan for vulnerabilities in HTTP connections.

2. Check for common vulnerabilities:
   - Look for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or file inclusion.
   - Use tools like "gobuster" to find possible directories and files that might contain sensitive information.

3. Perform a directory bruteforce:
   - Use tools like "gobuster" or "wfuzz" to find hidden directories or files in the web application.
   - For example: `gobuster dir -u http://jupiter.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

4. Test for HTTP response splitting attacks:
   - Test for HTTP response splitting attacks by using tools like "safetiSqli" or "gau" to see if the web application is vulnerable.
   - For example: `safetiSqli jupiter.htb` or `gau jupiter.htb`

5. Check for open redirects:
   - Test for open redirects by trying to redirect the web application to a malicious site using tools like "ffuf" or "gobuster".
   - For example: `ffuf -u http://jupiter.htb/?redirect=http://attacker.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`

6. Test for LFI/RFI vulnerabilities:
   - Test for Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities by using tools like "wfuzz" or "ffuf".
   - For example: `wfuzz -c <wordlist> -u http://jupiter.htb/?include=file`

7. Test for CSRF vulnerabilities:
   - Test for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities by using tools like "wfuzz" or "gau".
   - For example: `wfuzz -c <wordlist> -u http://jupiter.htb/?action=<action>`

8. Analyze the source code:
   - Manually analyze the source code of the web application to look for any vulnerabilities or clues about the underlying technology.
   - Use tools like "grep" or "htmldecoder" to search for specific keywords or patterns in the source code.

9. Use a web vulnerability scanner:
   - Use a web vulnerability scanner like "w3af" or "nikto" to automatically scan the web application for vulnerabilities.
   - For example: `w3af -u http://jupiter.htb`

By following these steps, you will be able to further explore the web application and identify potential vulnerabilities.
