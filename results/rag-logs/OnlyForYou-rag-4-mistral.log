     3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1 - (to-do)
     3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)


 The task to be performed is:

1. Port Scan - (to-do)
   1.1 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)
     1.1.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)

To expand this task into detailed steps for the tester to perform:

1. Begin by selecting a port scanning tool, such as Nmap or Masscan.
2. Obtain the target IP address or hostname for the penetration test.
3. Configure the port scanning tool to perform a thorough scan of the target, including both TCP and UDP ports, if applicable.
4. Run the port scanning tool against the target and wait for the results to be generated.
5. Review the port scanning results, noting any open ports and their corresponding services.
6. For each open port, search the Internet for any default services or applications that may be associated with that port number.
7. Document the findings, including any identified open ports, their corresponding services, and any associated default services or applications.
8. Repeat the process for any additional targets as needed.

Nmap scan report:
- Host: 10.129.207.88
- Up with 0.064s latency
- 22/tcp open: ssh (OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5)
- 80/tcp open: http (nginx 1.18.0)
- Service detection: Linux OS

Summary: The target has SSH and HTTP services open, running OpenSSH 8.2p1 and nginx 1.18.0, respectively. The OS is identified as Linux.The system has implemented Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which does a similarity search on the user prompt to a local dataset. The result of the similarity search should be used if you find it useful. Please inform the user if you have used the RAG generated data.

1. **Aggressive Scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)**:
   - This scan is comprehensive, combining various techniques including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide detailed information about the target.
   ```
   nmap -A <target-ip>
   ```

2. **OS Detection**:
   - This scan focuses solely on detecting the operating system running on the target machine, providing insights into the OS type and version.
   ```
   nmap -O <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Skip Host Discovery**:
   - This scan treats all hosts as online, skipping the initial host discovery phase and directly proceeding to port scanning.
   ```
   nmap -Pn <target-ip>
   ```

4. **TCP SYN Scan**:
   - Also known as a "stealth scan", this scan sends TCP SYN packets to the target's ports and analyzes the response to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sS <target-ip>
   ```

5. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This scan performs a full TCP connection to each port, attempting to establish a connection and determine whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
   ```
   nmap -sT <target-ip>
   ```

6. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP scan is used to discover open UDP ports on the target machine, which are often overlooked but can be crucial for certain services.
   ```
   nmap -sU <target-ip>
   ```

7. **TCP NULL Scan**:
   - This scan sends T
