 Based on the provided PTT, the next task to be executed is "1.3 Identify Open Ports and Services."

Here is a detailed expansion of the task:

1.3.1 Perform a full port scan:
   - The tester should use a port scanning tool, such as Nmap, to scan the target system for open ports.
   - The tester should use the appropriate command for the selected tool, e.g., `nmap -sV -p- target_ip`.
   - The command will scan all open ports and display the results, including the port number, protocol, and service name.

1.3.2 Determine the purpose of each open port:
   - The tester should analyze the port scanning results and identify the purpose of each open port.
   - The tester can use online resources, such as port-specific websites or service databases, to determine the purpose of each port.
   - The tester should list each open port, its purpose, and any relevant information for further analysis.

How to perform the task:
User Enumeration involves identifying the users and their roles on the target system. This helps in understanding the system's access control and determining potential attack vectors. To perform User Enumeration, one can use tools like 'crack' and 'John the Ripper' to crack passwords and gather usernames. Additionally, reviewing system logs and analyzing authentication attempts can also reveal user information.
