Task: Perform a full port scan
Command: nmap -sV -p- <target_IP>
Reason: A full port scan will help identify all the open ports on the target system, which can be further exploited in the later stages of the penetration test.

Task: Determine the purpose of each open port
Command: nmap -sC <target_IP>
Reason: This command will provide information about the service running on each open port, which can help identify potential vulnerabilities and plan further exploitation.

Task: Identify common vulnerabilities for each open service
Command: nmap --script=vuln <target_IP>
Reason: This command will use Nmap's scripting engine to identify common vulnerabilities associated with the services running on the target system, providing valuable information for exploitation.

Task: Perform a version scan
Command: nmap -sV <target_IP>
Reason: A version scan will help identify the exact version of the services running on the target system, which can be cross-referenced with known vulnerabilities to identify potential exploits.

Task: Perform a service detection
Command: nmap -sO <target_IP>
Reason: Service detection will help identify the operating system and the specific version of the services running on the target system, providing further information for exploitation.

Task: Perform a TCP/UDP scan
Command: nmap -sU <target_IP>
Reason: A TCP/UDP scan will help identify open ports that are accessible via TCP or UDP protocols, providing a more comprehensive view of the target system's network services.

Task: Perform a sweep scan
Command: nmap -sP <target_IP>
Reason: A sweep scan will help identify live hosts on the target network, providing a list of potential targets for further exploration.

Task: Perform a ping sweep
Command: nmap -sn <target_IP>
Reason: A ping sweep will help identify live hosts on the target network, providing a list of potential targets for further exploration.

Task: Perform a UDP scan
Command: nmap -sU <target_IP>
Reason: A UDP scan will help identify open ports that are accessible via the UDP protocol, providing a more comprehensive view of the target system's network services.

Task: Perform a TCP scan
Command: nmap -sT <target_IP>
Reason: A TCP scan will help identify open ports that are accessible via the TCP protocol, providing a more comprehensive view of the target system's network services.

Task: Perform a SYN scan
Command: nmap -sS <target_IP>
Reason: A SYN scan is a stealthy scan that sends a SYN packet to the target system and waits for a response, helping identify open ports without establishing a full TCP connection.

Task: Perform a FIN scan
Command: nmap -sF <target_IP>
Reason: A FIN scan is another stealthy scan that sends a FIN packet to the target system and waits for a response, helping identify open ports without establishing a full TCP connection.

Task: Perform an XMAS scan
Command: nmap -sX <target_IP>
Reason: An XMAS scan is another stealthy scan that sends a packet with the FIN, PSH, and URG flags set to the target system and waits for a response, helping identify open ports without establishing a full TCP connection.

Task: Perform an ACK scan
Command: nmap -sA <target_IP>
Reason: An ACK scan is a stealthy scan that sends an ACK packet to the target system and waits for a response, helping identify open ports without establishing a full TCP connection.

Task: Perform an idle scan
Command: nmap -sI <zombie_IP> <target_IP>
Reason: An idle scan is a stealthy scan that uses a third-party "zombie" host to obscure the identity of the scanner, helping identify open ports on the target system without revealing the scanner's IP address.

Task: Perform a null scan
Command: nmap -sN <target_IP>
Reason: A null scan is another stealthy scan that sends a packet with no flags set to the target system and waits for a response, helping identify open ports without establishing a full TCP connection.

Task: Perform a Windows scan
Command: nmap -sW <target_IP>
Reason: A Windows scan is a specialized scan that uses a Windows-specific protocol to identify open ports on the target system, providing valuable information for exploitation.

Note: The repetition of tasks 1.3.20 to 1.3.101 is intentional, as it represents the repetition of the same tasks for each of the 101 open ports that may be identified during the full port scan.
