 Based on the provided information, the task to be executed is:

1.3 Identify Open Ports and Services

Here's a detailed, step-by-step guide for the penetration tester:

1.3.1 Perform a full port scan:
- Use a port scanning tool like Nmap to scan the target IP address or hostname.
- Execute the command: nmap -p- -sV -A [target IP address or hostname]
- This command will scan all open ports (using the -p- option), identify the services running on those ports (using the -sV option), and provide additional information about the target (using the -A option).

1.3.2 Determine the purpose of each open port:
- Review the port scan results to identify the open ports and their corresponding services.
- Use online resources, such as websites like Shodan or port-specific websites, to determine the purpose of each open port.
- Document the information gathered about each open port and its related service.

Please continue with the next task, "Network Scanning."
