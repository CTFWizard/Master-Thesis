Task: 1.3.1.1 Use nmap to scan ports

Step 1: Open the terminal or command prompt on your system.

Step 2: Type the following command to install nmap if it is not already installed:
```
sudo apt-get install nmap
```

Step 3: Now, use nmap to perform a full port scan on the target IP address. Replace `<target_IP>` with the actual IP address of the target system.
```
nmap -sS -p- <target_IP>
```

Step 4: This command will scan all ports (`-p-`) on the target IP address. The `-sS` option is used to perform a TCP SYN scan, which is a stealthy scan that does not complete the TCP handshake.

Step 5: Review the output of the nmap scan. It will display the open ports and their corresponding service information.

Reason: Performing a full port scan with nmap is an essential step in the penetration testing process. It helps identify open ports and services on the target system, which can then be further analyzed for potential vulnerabilities.

user_prompt: User ran more command.
response: Task: 1.4.4 Use manual testing to identify vulnerabilities

Step 1: Review the open ports and services discovered during the full port scan.

Step 2: For each open port, research any known vulnerabilities associated with the corresponding service.

Step 3: Analyze the results of the nessus scan, if available, for any additional information on potential vulnerabilities.

Step 4: Use manual testing techniques, such as attempting to exploit any identified vulnerabilities, to confirm their existence and assess their potential impact.

Step 5: Document any discovered vulnerabilities, along with their potential impact and any relevant information, such as the specific port and service involved.

Reason: Manual testing is an essential part of the penetration testing process, as it allows the tester to verify the existence of potential vulnerabilities and assess their potential impact. This step helps ensure that any discovered vulnerabilities are accurately identified and can be properly addressed by the target system's administrators.

user_prompt: User ran more command.
response: Task: 1.4.4 Use manual testing to identify vulnerabilities

Step 1: Review the open ports and services discovered during the full port scan.

Step 2: For each open port, research any known vulnerabilities associated with the corresponding service.

Step 3: Use manual testing techniques, such as attempting to exploit any identified vulnerabilities, to confirm their existence and assess their potential impact.

Step 4: Document any discovered vulnerabilities, along with their potential impact and any relevant information, such as the specific port and service involved.

Reason: Manual testing is an essential part of the penetration testing process, as it allows the tester to verify the existence of potential vulnerabilities and assess their potential impact. This step helps ensure that any discovered vulnerabilities are accurately identified and can be properly addressed by the target system's administrators.

Note that the usage of automated scanners such as Nessus and OpenVAS is not allowed.
