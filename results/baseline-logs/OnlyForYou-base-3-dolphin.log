Identify Open Ports and Services - (to-do)

1.3.1 Perform a full port scan

Step 1: Use nmap to scan all ports
Usage: `nmap -p- <target_IP>`
Explanation: This command will scan all ports on the target IP address.

Step 2: Use masscan to scan all ports
Usage: `masscan -p0-65535 <target_IP>`
Explanation: This command will scan all ports on the target IP address using masscan, a fast port scanner.

1.3.2 Determine the purpose of each open port

Step 1: Use nmap scripts to identify service versions
Usage: `nmap -sV <target_IP>`
Explanation: This command will use nmap's version detection to identify the service versions running on the target IP address.

Step 2: Use online service port scanners
