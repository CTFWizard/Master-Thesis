Alright, let's break down the task for the tester. The task to be executed is:

1. Identify Open Ports and Services - (to-do)
   1.3.1 Perform a full port scan - (to-do)

To perform a full port scan, follow these steps:

1. Install a port scanner tool, such as Nmap (Network Mapper).
2. Open the command prompt or terminal on your system.
3. Type the command `nmap -sS -p- <target_IP>` and press Enter.
    - Replace `<target_IP>` with the IP address of the target system.
4. The output will display the open ports and their corresponding service names.

Remember to keep the output short and precise, without too detailed instructions.

To perform the task, first, use the 'telnet' command to establish a connection to the target IP on port 55555. Then, observe the response to identify any clues about the open source software powering the application.

Note: The tester's question is relevant, as it can help identify potential vulnerabilities or exploits related to the software powering the application on port 55555. Therefore, the PTT has been updated to include this task.





















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































All possible todo tasks:
1.3.2.1 Identify the SSH service
1.3.2.3 Identify the unknown service on port 8338
1.3.2.4 Identify the unknown service on port 55555
1.3.2.5 Identify the open source software powering the application on port 55555
1.3.3 Identify the highest open TCP port

Favorable sub-task: 
1.3.2.5 Identify the open source software powering the application on port 55555

Explanation:
To perform the task, first, use the 'telnet' command to establish a connection to the target IP on port 55555. Then, observe the response to identify any clues about the open source software powering the application.

Note: The tester's question is relevant, as it can help identify potential vulnerabilities or exploits related to the software powering the application on port 55555. Therefore, the PTT has been updated to include this task.
