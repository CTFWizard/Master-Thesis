You can follow the instructions below to complete the tasks.Task: Use Metasploit to search for SSH exploits

Step 1: Open the terminal or command prompt.

Step 2: Type the following command to install Metasploit if it is not already installed:
```
sudo apt-get install metasploit-framework
```

Step 3: Type the following command to open Metasploit:
```
msfconsole
```

Step 4: Type the following command to search for SSH exploits:
```
search ssh
```

Step 5: Review the search results for available SSH exploits.

Step 6: Document the findings in the PTT.

Note: The actual exploitation of the SSH port will depend on the specific vulnerability found and the available exploits. The tester should follow the appropriate steps for exploiting the specific vulnerability found in the target system.
