The task to be executed is:

1.3.1 Perform a full port scan - (to-do)

Guidance for the tester:

1. First, install and set up Nmap on your system if it is not already installed. Nmap is a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.
3. To perform a full port scan, use the following command:

```
nmap -p 1-65535 <target_IP>
```

Replace `<target_IP>` with the IP address of the target system you want to scan.
4. Press Enter to execute the command. Nmap will scan all ports (1-65535) on the target system and display the results, including the open ports and their corresponding services.
5. Take note of the open ports and their services, as this information will be useful for further analysis and exploitation.

Remember to always perform penetration testing with proper authorization and adhere to ethical hacking practices.

The most favorable sub-task that is likely to lead to a successful exploit is:

* 1.15.3 Use the discovered information to identify potential vulnerabilities - [not applicable]

To perform this task, you can analyze the response received from the web application at http://superpass.htb/ to identify any potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This may involve using tools like Burp Suite or ZAP to intercept and manipulate HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses.

However, before proceeding with this task, it is essential to gather more information about the web application's functionalities and underlying technologies. This can be achieved by using tools like WhatWeb or performing manual reconnaissance using a web browser.

Based on the tester's input, the target web application at port 80 redirects the user to http://superpass.htb/. This information can be useful for further reconnaissance and exploitation.

Considering the tester's input, you can add the following task:

* 1.15.4 Perform manual reconnaissance using a web browser - [not applicable]

This task will involve using a web browser to explore the web application at http://superpass.htb/ and observe its behavior, functionalities, and underlying technologies. This information can be useful for identifying potential vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.

The most favorable sub-task that is likely to lead to a successful exploit is:

* 1.15.3 Use the discovered information to identify potential vulnerabilities - [not applicable]

To perform this task, you can analyze the response received from the web application at http://superpass.htb/ to identify any potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This may involve using tools like Burp Suite or ZAP to intercept and manipulate HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses.

However, before proceeding with this task, it is essential to gather more information about the web application's functionalities and underlying technologies. This can be achieved by using tools like WhatWeb or performing manual reconnaissance using a web browser.

Based on the tester's input, the target web application at port 80 redirects the user to http://superpass.htb/. This information can be useful for further reconnaissance and exploitation.

Considering the tester's input, you can add the following task:

* 1.15.4 Perform manual reconnaissance using a web browser - [not applicable]

This task will involve using a web browser to explore the web application at http://superpass.htb/ and observe its behavior, functionalities, and underlying technologies. This information can be useful for identifying potential vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.
