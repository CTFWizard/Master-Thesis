Note: The tester is asking for commands using grpcurl. To use grpcurl, you need to install it on your system and then use it to send requests to the gRPC service. Here are some example commands:

1. To list all available services:
```
grpcurl -plaintext -import-metadata 10.10.11.214:50051 list

Summary:

1. Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.214
2. Host is up (0.027s latency)
3. Not shown: 65533 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
4. 22/tcp open ssh
5. OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
6. 50051/tcp open gRPC

Interesting points:

1. The host is responsive with a low latency.
2. There are 65533 filtered tcp ports, which might indicate a firewall or other security measures.
3. SSH service is open on port 22, with OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) version.
4. A gRPC service is open on port 50051. Further investigation is needed to identify the service and its potential vulnerabilities.

Notes:

1. The operating system is identified as Ubuntu Linux.
2. The only relevant service discovered so far is SSH on port 22.
3. The gRPC service on port 50051 requires further investigation.

Favorable sub-task:

1.3.7.1 Identify potential SSH vulnerabilities - [to-do]

Explanation:

1. To perform this task, first, gather information about the SSH version (OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7) and the operating system (Ubuntu Linux).
2. Then, use manual methods or online resources to search for known vulnerabilities in the identified SSH version and operating system.
