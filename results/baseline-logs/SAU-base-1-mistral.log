 Based on the given information, the task to be performed is:

"Task: Perform vulnerability scanning (to-do)"

To expand this task into detailed steps for the tester to perform:

1. Choose a vulnerability scanning tool, such as Nessus, OpenVAS, or Qualys.
2. Configure the scanner with the target organization's IP range or domain name.
3. Launch the vulnerability scan and wait for the process to complete.
4. Review the scan results to identify any vulnerabilities present in the target organization's systems.
5. Document the vulnerabilities and their details, including the CVSS score, affected software or hardware, and any mitigations or patches available.
6. If necessary, prioritize the vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and ease of exploitation.

Remember, the penetration testing is in a simulated environment and the above steps are for educational purposes only.
