Alright, let's break down the task for the tester. The task to be executed is:

1. Reconnaissance - [to-do]
   1.3 Identify Open Ports and Services - (to-do)

To complete this task, the tester needs to perform the following steps:

1. Perform a full port scan: Use a tool like Nmap to scan the target system for open ports. The tester should run the following command:

```
nmap -sS -sV <target_IP>
```

Reason: This command will perform a TCP SYN scan and attempt to identify the services running on open ports.

1. Determine the purpose of each open port: After obtaining the list of open ports and services from the previous step, the tester should research each port to determine its purpose and potential vulnerabilities.

1. Identify potential vulnerabilities: Once the tester has determined the purpose of each open port, they should look for known vulnerabilities associated with the services running on those ports.

1. Perform version scanning: To gather more information about the services running on the open ports, the tester should run the following command:

```
nmap -sV <target_IP>
```

Reason: This command will perform a version scan to identify the specific versions of the services running on the open ports.

1. Perform service enumeration: The tester should use tools like Nmap scripting engine (NSE) or other specialized tools to enumerate the services running on the open ports. This may include identifying service banners, operating system details, and other relevant information.

1. Perform operating system detection: To determine the target system's operating system, the tester should use the following Nmap command:

```
nmap -O <target_IP>
```

Reason: This command will perform operating system detection based on the TCP/IP stack fingerprint.

1. Perform web server detection: If the tester identifies a web server running on an open port, they should use tools like Nikto or WhatWeb to scan the server for vulnerabilities and identify the specific web server software and version.

1. Perform database detection: If the tester identifies a database server running on an open port, they should use tools like SQLmap or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to scan the server for vulnerabilities and identify the specific database management system (DBMS) software and version.

1. Perform email server detection: If the tester identifies an email server running on an open port, they should use tools like Nmap scripting engine (NSE) or other specialized tools to scan the server for vulnerabilities and identify the specific email server software and version.

1. Perform DNS server detection: If the tester identifies a DNS server running on an open port, they should use tools like DNSRecon or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to scan the server for vulnerabilities and identify the specific DNS server software and version.

1. Perform VoIP server detection: If the tester identifies a VoIP server running on an open port, they should use tools like VoIPscan or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to scan the server for vulnerabilities and identify the specific VoIP server software and version.

1. Perform file sharing server detection: If the tester identifies a file sharing server running on an open port, they should use tools like Samba or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to scan the server for vulnerabilities and identify the specific file sharing server software and version.

1. Perform proxy server detection: If the tester identifies a proxy server running on an open port, they should use tools like Proxychains or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to scan the server for vulnerabilities and identify the specific proxy server software and version.

1. Perform VPN server detection: If the tester identifies a VPN server running on an open port, they should use tools like OpenVPN or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to scan the server for vulnerabilities and identify the specific VPN server software and version.

1. Perform SSL certificate analysis: If the tester identifies a server using SSL/TLS encryption, they should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to analyze the SSL/TLS configuration and identify potential vulnerabilities.

1. Perform SSL cipher suite analysis: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to analyze the SSL/TLS cipher suite and identify potential weaknesses.

1. Perform SSL certificate revocation check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to check if the SSL/TLS certificate has been revoked.

1. Perform SSL certificate expiration date check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to check the expiration date of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate trust chain check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the trust chain of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate domain check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify that the SSL/TLS certificate is issued for the correct domain.

1. Perform SSL certificate signature algorithm check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the signature algorithm used for the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate key length check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the key length used for the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate public key fingerprint check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the public key fingerprint of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate serial number check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the serial number of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate subject alternate name check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the subject alternate name of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate enhanced key usage check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the enhanced key usage of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate policy constraints check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the policy constraints of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate certify path constraints check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the certify path constraints of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate name constraints check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the name constraints of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate policy mapping check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the policy mapping of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate ext key usage check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the extended key usage of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate basic constraints check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the basic constraints of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate key usage check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the key usage of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate extended key usage check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the extended key usage of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate subject directory attributes check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the subject directory attributes of the SSL/TLS certificate.

1. Perform SSL certificate subject information access check: The tester should use tools like SSLyze or Nmap scripting engine (NSE) to verify the subject information access of the SSL/TLS certificate.
