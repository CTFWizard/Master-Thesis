  3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1 - (to-do)
  3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)

All tasks are currently in the "to-do" status.


 Task: 1.2 - Perform Port Scan

Sub-task: 1.2.1 - Identify Open Ports

Step 1: Launch a network scanning tool, such as Nmap.

Step 2: Set the appropriate options for the scan, such as the target IP address, port range, and scan type.

Step 3: Run the network scanning tool to identify open ports on the target system.

Step 4: Analyze the scan results to determine which ports are open, and note any potential vulnerabilities or interesting services.

Step 5: Document the findings in a report, including the target IP address, open ports, and associated services.

Step 6: Share the report with the penetration testing team for further analysis and potential exploitation.

Task: 2.1 - Investigate the service

Sub-task: 2.1.1 - Gather information about the service

Step 1: Research the specific service running on the target system.

Step 2: Determine the purpose of the service and its function within the target system.

Step 3: Identify any known vulnerabilities or security issues associated with the service.

Step 4: Document the findings in a report, including the service name, purpose, and known vulnerabilities.

Step 5: Share the report with the penetration testing team to inform them of the service and its potential vulnerabilities.

Task: 3.1 - Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1

Sub-task: 3.1.1 - Scan the local network for open ports

Step 1: Launch a network scanning tool, such as Nmap.

Step 2: Set the appropriate options for the scan, such as the target IP address (127.0.0.1) and port range.

Step 3: Run the network scanning tool to identify open ports on the local network.

Step 4: Analyze the scan results to determine which ports are open, and note any potential vulnerabilities or interesting services.

Step 5: Document the findings in a report, including the target IP address, open ports, and associated services.

Step 6: Share the report with the penetration testing team for further analysis and potential exploitation.

Task: 3.2 - Scan for files that current user runs as root

Sub-task: 3.2.1 - Identify files that have root privileges

Step 1: Gather a list of files and processes currently running on the target system.

Step 2: Investigate each file and process to determine if the current user has root privileges.

Step 3: Document the findings in a report, including the file names, processes, and their associated privileges.

Step 4: Share the report with the penetration testing team to inform them of the files and processes with root privileges.

Selected sub-task: 3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1

To perform this task:
1. Use the 'netstat' command to view the active TCP connections and TCP/UDP ports in use on the local machine.
2. Identify any open ports on the local network that may provide access to additional services or systems.
