user_prompt: I have a Linux hack the box machine. The target IP is 10.129.70.216
response: 1. Reconnaissance - (to-do)
  1.1 Passive Information Gathering - (complete)
  1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)
    1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)
    1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)

  2.1 Investigate the service - (to-do)
3. Privilege Escalation - (to-do)
   3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1 - (to-do)
   3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)
Task: 1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)

Guidance:

1. Use a port scanner tool to scan the target system for open ports.
2. Execute the following command:
   ```
   nmap -sV <target_IP>
   ```
   Replace `<target_IP>` with the IP address of the target system.
3. The `-sV` option in the nmap command tells the tool to perform a version scan, which helps identify the services running on the open ports.

Reason:

Port scanning is an essential step in penetration testing, as it helps identify potential entry points for exploitation. By scanning for open ports, you can determine which services are running on the target system and potentially exploit any vulnerabilities in those services.
