 Task 1.2: Port Scan

Step 1: Choose the appropriate port scanning tool (e.g., Nmap, Nessus, etc.)
Step 2: Configure the scanning tool with the target IP range and settings
Step 3: Run the port scanning tool to collect information on open ports and services
Step 4: Analyze the scan results to identify potential vulnerabilities and
