 Based on the provided information, the task to be performed is:

```
1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)
  1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)
    1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)
```

To expand this task into detailed steps for the tester to perform:

1. Choose a port scanning tool: Select a port scanning tool that you are familiar with or one that is recommended for penetration testing. Popular options include Nmap, Nessus, and Wireshark.

2. Set up the tool: Install and configure the chosen port scanning tool according to the requirements specified in the penetration testing engagement.

3. Define scan parameters: Determine the appropriate parameters for the port scan, such as the target IP address (10.10.11.222), port range, and desired scan type (e.g., TCP, UDP, or both).

4. Perform the scan: Launch the port scanning tool and initiate the scan using the defined parameters. This process may take some time, depending on the size of the target network and the number of open ports.

5. Analyze the results: Review the scan results to identify any open ports and any services defaulting to those ports. Note down any findings that could be relevant to the penetration testing engagement.

6. Document the process: Record the steps taken, tools used, and any findings in the penetration testing report to provide a comprehensive overview of the port scanning activity.

7. Repeat as necessary: Depending on the scope of the penetration test, it may be necessary to repeat this process with different tools or parameters to ensure thorough coverage of the target network.

Some methods to interact with SMB include:

1. Using tools like SMBclient, Nmap, and Metasploit to scan, enum, and exploit SMB services.
2. Gathering information about the target system by enumerating shares, users, and groups.
3. Check for vulnerabilities in the SMB services, such as missing security updates, misconfigurations, or known exploits.
4. Utilizing SMB relay attacks, SMB packet manipulation, or other techniques to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access.

To expand this task into detailed steps for the tester to perform:

1. Choose a service investigation tool: Select a service investigation tool that you are familiar with or one that is recommended for penetration testing. Popular options include Nmap, Nessus, and Wireshark.

2. Set up the tool: Install and configure the chosen service investigation tool according to the requirements specified in the penetration testing engagement.

3. Define scan parameters: Determine the appropriate parameters for the service investigation, such as the target IP address (10.10.11.222), port range, and desired scan type (e.g., TCP, UDP, or both).

4. Perform the scan: Launch the service investigation tool and initiate the scan using the defined parameters. This process may take some time, depending on the size of the target network and the number of open ports.

5. Analyze the results: Review the scan results to identify any services running on the local network (127.0.0.1) and any files that the current user runs as root. Note down any findings that could be relevant to the penetration testing engagement.

6. Document the process: Record the steps taken, tools used, and any findings in the penetration testing report to provide a comprehensive overview of the service investigation and port scanning activity.

7. Repeat as necessary: Depending on the scope of the penetration test, it may be necessary to repeat this process with different tools or parameters to ensure thorough coverage of the target network.

user_prompt: Discuss | Let's use smbclient, can you give me some commands?
response:  To use smbclient for penetration testing, you can follow these steps:

1. Install smbclient: Ensure smbclient is installed on your penetration testing system. On most Linux distributions, you can install it using your package manager.

2. Connect to the target: Use the smbclient command to connect to the target SMB server using the IP address or hostname and the desired share name. For example, to connect to the target IP 10.10.11.222 with the share name "IIS_Admin_Share":

```
smbclient //10.10.11.222/IIS_Admin_Share
```

3. Analyze the shares: Once connected, you can list the available shares using the "ls" command. For example:

```
ls
```

4. Download files: To download a file from the share, use the "get" command followed by the file name. For example, to download the file "index.html":

```
get index.html
```

5. Upload files: To upload a file to the share, use the "put" command followed by the file name. For example, to upload the file "test.txt":

```
put test.txt
```

6. List users and groups: To list the users and groups on the target SMB server, use the "enum users" and "enum groups" commands. For example:

```
enum users
enum groups
```

7. Close the connection: When you are finished with smbclient, use the "exit" command to close the connection. For example:

```
exit
```

user_prompt: Discuss | The command smbclient //10.10.11.222/IIS_Admin_Share: 
Results in required password, which i do not have:
smbclient //10.10.11.222//IIS_Admin_Share
Password for [WORKGROUP\user]:
response:  To resolve the issue of not having the required password, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the target: Ensure you have identified the correct target IP address and share name for the SMB server. In this case, the target IP is 10.10.11.222, and the share name is IIS_Admin_Share.

2. Research the target: Research the target to gather any available information on the target SMB server, including usernames, passwords, or exploits that may be used to gain access.

3. Use a password-cracking tool: Utilize a password-cracking tool, such as John the Ripper or Hashcat, to crack the password for the target SMB server. These tools can be used to brute-force or dictionary-attack the password.

4. Exploit vulnerabilities: If there are known vulnerabilities in the SMB server, exploit them to gain access to the share without needing the password. This could involve using Metasploit or other exploit frameworks.

5. Gain access to the share: Once you have either cracked the password or exploited a vulnerability, use the smbclient command with the correct password or exploit to connect to the target SMB server. For example:

```
smbclient //10.10.11.222/IIS_Admin_Share -U user%password
```

6. Perform the desired actions: Now that you have access to the share, perform the desired actions, such as listing the shares, downloading files, uploading files, listing users and groups, and closing the connection.

Remember to always operate within the bounds of your ethical hacking guidelines and with permission from the target network owner.
