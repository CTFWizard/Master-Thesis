    1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)

Step 1: Prepare the port scanning tool
- Choose an appropriate port scanning tool, such as Nmap, to scan for open ports on the target network.

Step 2: Configure the port scanning tool
- Set the tool's options according to the objectives of the penetration test, such as specifying the range of ports to scan or enabling OS detection.

Step 3: Perform the port scan
- Run the port scanning tool against the target network, allowing it to identify open ports and any services defaulting to those ports.

Step 4: Analyze the port scan results
- Review the results of the port scan, noting any open ports and the services associated with them.

Step 2: Investigate the service
- Research the service running on the Open Ports to gain more information about it, such as its version, known vulnerabilities, and common attack vectors.

Step 3: Check for default credentials or common vulnerabilities
- Look for any default credentials associated with the service or common vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain access to the system.

Step 3: Look for ports on the local network
- Scan for open ports on the local network (127.0.0.1) to identify any additional systems that may be accessible.

Step 4: Identify other systems on the local network
- Use the results of the local network port scan to identify other systems that can be targeted during the penetration test.

Step 5: Explore potential attack vectors for lateral movement
- Analyze the identified systems to determine the most effective attack vectors for lateral movement between them, considering factors such as network architecture, security controls, and the target organization's security posture.

Note: The steps for Post-Exploitation, Cleanup, and Privilege Escalation are skipped in the given information.

 1. Task: Identify the service running on the Open Ports
   - Sub-task: Check for any default credentials or common vulnerabilities
   - Explanation: To perform this task, we need to identify the service running on the open ports and then search for default credentials or common vulnerabilities associated with the service. This will help us in finding potential ways to exploit the system.

2. Task: Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1
   - Explanation: In this task, we need to look for any open ports on the local network 127.0.0.1. This will help us in identifying potential services that we can target for further exploitation.

3. Task: Scan for files that current user runs as root
   - Explanation: In this task, we need to scan the system for files that the current user has permission to run with root privileges. This will help us in identifying potential ways to escalate our privileges on the system.

4. Task: Identify other systems on the local network
   - Explanation: In this task, we need to identify other systems connected to the local network. This will help us in determining the scope of our attack and identifying potential targets for lateral movement.

5. Task: Explore potential attack vectors for lateral movement
   - Explanation: In this task, we need to analyze the identified systems on the local network and explore potential attack vectors that can be used to move laterally across the network. This will help us in expanding our attack surface and potentially gaining access to more sensitive information.

6. Task: Exfiltrate sensitive data
   - Explanation: In this task, we need to extract sensitive data from the compromised system. This will help us in achieving our objectives and proving the success of our exploit.

7. Task: Maintain persistence
   - Explanation: In this task, we need to ensure that our presence on the compromised system remains undetected and that we can continue our activities even after rebooting or patching the system. This will help us in maintaining access to the system for an extended period.

8. Task: Cover tracks
   - Explanation: In this task, we need to remove all traces of our presence on the compromised system and make it appear as if nothing happened. This will help us in avoiding detection and ensuring the success of our exploit.

9. Task: Remove all traces of the attack
   - Explanation: In this task, we need to clean up our presence on the compromised system and eliminate any evidence of our attack. This will help us in ensuring that we don't leave any traces that can be used to identify us as the attacker.
