Please note that this is a base structure and may vary based on the specific penetration testing scenario.


 Possible todo tasks:
1. Investigate the service
2. Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1
3. Scan for files that current user runs as root

Selecting one sub-task: Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1

To perform the task:
1. Identify the local IP address of the target system (10.10.11.211).
2. Scan for open ports on the local network (127.0.0.1) using tools like netcat or nmap.



You can follow the instructions below to complete the tasks. Based on the given information, the penetration tester has completed reconnaissance and initial access tasks and is now working on the privilege escalation phase. To assist the penetration tester, consider the following steps to complete the given task:

1. Identify the local IP address: Use the "ifconfig" command to identify the local IP address of the target system.

2. Scan for open ports: Use the "netcat" or "nmap" command to scan for open ports on the local network (127.0.0.1).

3. Analyze the results: Review the scan results and identify any open ports that may be exploitable.

4. Identify potential vulnerabilities: Research and identify potential vulnerabilities associated with the open ports discovered during the scan.

5. Exploit the vulnerabilities: Utilize the identified vulnerabilities to attempt privilege escalation on the target system.

6. Document findings: Organize and document the results of the privileges escalation attempt, including vulnerabilities identified, exploits executed, and recommendations for remediation.

7. Responsible disclosure: If the penetration test was conducted on a legitimate target, responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities and recommendations to the target organization.
