user_prompt: I have a Linux hack the box machine. The target IP is 10.129.228.231
response: 1. Reconnaissance - (to-do)
  1.1 Passive Information Gathering - (complete)
  1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)
    1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)
    1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)

   3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)
Task: 1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)

Guidance:

1. Use the `nmap` command to scan the target system for open ports.
2. Execute the following command:
```
nmap -sS -Pn <target_IP>
```
3. Replace `<target_IP>` with the IP address of the target system.
4. This command will perform a TCP SYN scan on the target system, identifying open ports and providing information about the services running on them.
5. Review the scan results to identify open ports and their corresponding services.
6. Proceed to the next sub-task: 1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)
