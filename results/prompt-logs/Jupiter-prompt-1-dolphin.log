Task: 1.3 Identify Open Ports

Step 1: Install the necessary tools
Before proceeding with the port scan, ensure that you have the necessary tools installed on your system. Some popular tools for port scanning include Nmap, Zenmap, and Masscan.

Step 2: Start the port scan
Start the port scan using the Nmap tool. You can use the following command to scan the target IP address (192.168.1.100) for open ports:
```
nmap -sS -p- 192.168.1.100
```
Explanation:

* `-sS`: This option specifies a TCP SYN scan, which is a common method for scanning ports.
* `-p-`: This option scans all ports (from 1 to 65535).
* `192.168.1.100`: This is the IP address of the target system.

Step 3: Analyze the results
After running the port scan, Nmap will display a list of open ports on the target system. Analyze the results to identify any potential vulnerabilities or services that could be exploited.

Task: 1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports

Step 1: Identify the services
Review the list of open ports from the previous step and identify the services running on each port. You can use the following command to get more information about a specific port and its associated service:
```
nmap -sV -p <port_number> 192.168.1.100
```
Explanation:

* `-sV`: This option specifies a version detection scan, which can help identify the specific version of the service running on the port.
* `<port_number>`: Replace this with the port number you want to scan (e.g., 80 for HTTP).
* `192.168.1.100`: This is the IP address of the target system.

Step 2: Search for known vulnerabilities
Once you have identified the services running on the open ports, search for known vulnerabilities associated with those services. You can use various resources, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), Exploit-DB, or Google.

Task: 2.1 Investigate the service

Step 1: Connect to the service
Use a web browser or a specific client for the service (e.g., FTP client) to connect to the service running on the target system.

Step 2: Analyze the service
Examine the service to identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses. Look for common issues, such as outdated software versions, weak authentication mechanisms, or insecure configurations.

Task: 3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1

Step 1: Start the port scan
Start the port scan using the Nmap tool. You can use the following command to scan the local network (127.0.0.1) for open ports:
```
nmap -sS -p- 127.0.0.1
```
Explanation:

* `-sS`: This option specifies a TCP SYN scan, which is a common method for scanning ports.
* `-p-`: This option scans all ports (from 1 to 65535).
* `127.0.0.1`: This is the IP address of the local network.

Step 2: Analyze the results
After running the port scan, Nmap will display a list of open ports on the local network. Analyze the results to identify any potential vulnerabilities or services that could be exploited.

Task: 3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root

Step 1: Install the necessary tools
Before proceeding with the file scan, ensure that you have the necessary tools installed on your system. Some popular tools for file scanning include LinPEAS and Unix-privesc-check.

Step 2: Run the file scan
Run the file scan using the specified tool. For example, to run LinPEAS, download the script and execute it with the following command:
```
bash linpeas.sh
```
Explanation:

* `bash`: This command executes the script using the Bash shell.
* `linpeas.sh`: This is the name of the LinPEAS script.

Step 3: Analyze the results
After running the file scan, the tool will display a list of files and directories that the current user has access to. Analyze the results to identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses, such as world-writable files, setuid/setgid files, or insecure permissions.
