   3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)
Task: 1.3 Identify Open Ports

Step 1: Execute the following command to perform a port scan on the target system:
```
nmap -sS -p- 192.168.1.1
```
Explanation: This command will scan all ports on the target IP address (192.168.1.1) using the TCP SYN scan method (-sS) to identify open ports.

Step 2: Review the output of the port scan to identify open ports and note them down.

Task: 1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports

Step 1: Use a search engine like Google to search for the default services associated with the open ports identified in the previous step. For example, if port 80 is open, search for "default services for port 80".

Step 2: Make a note of the default services associated with the open ports.

Task: 2.1 Investigate the service

Step 1: Use a tool like `nmap --script` to perform a more in-depth scan of the target system, focusing on the open ports and their associated services.
```
nmap --script=discover 192.168.1.1
```
Explanation: This command will perform a more detailed scan of the target system using the Nmap scripting engine (--script=discover) to discover potential vulnerabilities in the open ports and their associated services.

Step 2: Review the output of the script scan to identify any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the open ports and their associated services.

Task: 3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1

Step 1: Execute the following command to perform a port scan on the local network interface (127.0.0.1):
```
nmap -sS -p- 127.0.0.1
```
Explanation: This command will scan all ports on the local network interface using the TCP SYN scan method (-sS) to identify open ports on the local network.

Step 2: Review the output of the port scan to identify open ports on the local network and note them down.

Task: 3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root

Step 1: Use the `sudo -l` command to list the files and directories that the current user can access with sudo privileges.
```
sudo -l
```
Explanation: This command will display a list of commands and files that the current user can execute with sudo privileges, which may indicate potential privilege escalation opportunities.

Step 2: Review the output of the `sudo -l` command to identify any files or directories that the current user can access with sudo privileges.

Remember, always perform testing in a controlled environment and with proper authorization.

Tester's Question: "What is the difference between Passive Information Gathering and Port Scan?"

Answer: Passive Information Gathering involves collecting information about the target without directly interacting with it, such as searching publicly available information on the internet. Port Scan, on the other hand, involves actively probing the target's network ports to identify open ports and potentially vulnerable services.

Tester's Question: "Why do we need to identify open ports and services?"

Answer: Identifying open ports and services is crucial in the penetration testing process as it helps in determining potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain access to the target system.

Tester's Question: "What is the significance of Investigating the service after identifying open ports and services?"

Answer: Investigating the service after identifying open ports and services helps in understanding the underlying technology, version, and potential vulnerabilities of the service, which can be exploited during the Initial Access phase of the penetration testing process.

Tester's Question: "Why do we need to look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1?"

Answer: Looking for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1 helps in identifying any internal services or systems that may be accessible from the target system, which can be exploited during the Privilege Escalation phase of the penetration testing process.

Tester's Question: "Why do we need to scan for files that current user runs as root?"

Answer: Scanning for files that the current user runs as root helps in identifying any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the target system that may allow for privilege escalation and access to higher privileged accounts.

1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports: Once the open ports are identified, investigate each port to determine the running service.

The task tree has been updated. The selected task is 1.3 Identify Open Ports. To perform this task, use a tool like nmap to scan the target IP (10.129.229.56) and identify open ports. Once the open ports are identified, investigate each port to determine the running service.
You can follow the instructions below to complete the tasks.Task: 1.3 Identify Open Ports

Step 1: Execute the following command to perform a port scan on the target system:
```
nmap -sS -p- 10.129.229.56
```
Explanation: This command will scan all ports on the target IP address (10.129.229.56) using the TCP SYN scan method (-sS) to identify open ports.

Step 2: Review the output of the port scan to identify open ports and note them down.

Step 3: Use a search engine like Google to search for the default services associated with the open ports identified in the previous step. For example, if port 80 is open, search for "default services for port 80".

Step 4: Make a note of the default services associated with the open ports.

Task: 1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports

Step 1: Review the open ports identified in the previous task and note down the port numbers.

Step 2: Use a search engine like Google to search for the default services associated with each of the open ports identified in the previous step. For example, if port 80 is open, search for "default services for port 80".

Step 3: Make a note of the default services associated with the open ports.

Remember, always perform testing in a controlled environment and with proper authorization.

Tester's Question: "What is the difference between Passive Information Gathering and Port Scan?"

Answer: Passive Information Gathering involves collecting information about the target without directly interacting with it, such as searching publicly available information on the internet. Port Scan, on the other hand, involves actively probing the target's network ports to identify open ports and potentially vulnerable services.

Tester's Question: "Why do we need to identify open ports and services?"

Answer: Identifying open ports and services is crucial in the penetration testing process as it helps in determining potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain access to the target system.

Tester's Question: "What is the significance of Investigating the service after identifying open ports and services?"

Answer: Investigating the service after identifying open ports and services helps in understanding the underlying technology, version, and potential vulnerabilities of the service, which can be exploited during the Initial Access phase of the penetration testing process.

Tester's Question: "Why do we need to look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1?"

Answer: Looking for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1 helps in identifying any internal services or systems that may be accessible from the target system, which can be exploited during the Privilege Escalation phase of the penetration testing process.

Tester's Question: "Why do we need to scan for files that current user runs as root?"

Answer: Scanning for files that the current user runs as root helps in identifying any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the target system that may allow for privilege escalation and access to higher privileged accounts.
