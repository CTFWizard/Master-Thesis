1. Investigate the gRPC service at port 50051/tcp
2. Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1
3. Scan for files that current user runs as root

Since the task "Investigate the gRPC service at port 50051/tcp" is the most likely to lead to successful exploit, we will perform it.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1. Use a tool like grpcurl to analyze the gRPC service running on port 50051.
2. Look for any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the gRPC service, such as unauthenticated or unauthorized access, insecure communication channels, or other potential exploits.
