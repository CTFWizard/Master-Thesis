Note: This is the PTT for the given target IP 10.10.11.203.
Task: 1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)

Expanded Task:

1. Install Nmap, a network exploration and security auditing tool, if it is not already installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to perform a port scan on the target IP address (10.10.11.203):

```nmap -sT -sV -Pn 10.10.11.203```

* Explanation: This command will perform a TCP connect scan (-sT) on the specified IP address. The -sV option will attempt to identify the version of the services running on the open ports. The -Pn option will disable host discovery, which is useful when scanning through a firewall.

The output of the Nmap scan will provide you with a list of open ports on the target IP address, along with the services running on those ports. This information will help you identify potential vulnerabilities and proceed with further testing in the next steps.
