user_prompt: I have a Linux hack the box machine. The target IP is 10.129.228.212
response: 1. Reconnaissance - (to-do)
  1.1 Passive Information Gathering - (complete)
  1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)
    1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)
    1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)
2. Initial Access - (to-do)
  2.1 Investigate the service - (to-do)
3. Privilege Escalation - (to-do)
   3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1 - (to-do)
   3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)
Task: 1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)

Guidance:

1. Use the `nmap` command to scan the target system for open ports.

Command:
```
nmap -sS -p- TARGET-IP
```

Explanation:
The `nmap` command is a powerful tool for network exploration and security auditing. The `-sS` flag specifies a TCP SYN scan, which is a fast and reliable way to identify open ports. The `-p-` flag tells `nmap` to scan all ports, from 1 to 65535. Replace `TARGET-IP` with the IP address of the target system.

Task: 1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)

Guidance:

1. Use a search engine to find the default services associated with the open ports found in the previous step.

Command:
```
<search engine> "default service for port X"
```

Explanation:
Replace `<search engine>` with your preferred search engine, such as Google or Bing. Replace `X` with the port number found in the previous step. This will help you identify the default service associated with the open port, which can be helpful in understanding the target system's potential vulnerabilities.
