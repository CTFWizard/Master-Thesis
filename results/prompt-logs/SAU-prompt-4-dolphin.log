Task: 1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)

Command: nmap -sV -Pn 192.168.1.1

Reason: This command will scan the target IP address (192.168.1.1) for open ports and identify the services running on those ports. This information is crucial for further testing, as it allows you to identify potential vulnerabilities and plan your attack strategy.

Steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the command "nmap -sV -Pn 192.168.1.1" and press Enter.
3. Wait for the scan to complete. This may take a few minutes, depending on the target IP address and the number of ports being scanned.
4. Once the scan is complete, review the output to identify any open ports and the services running on those ports.
5. Document the results for future reference.

Remember to replace "192.168.1.1" with the actual target IP address.
