user_prompt: I have a Linux hack the box machine. The target IP is 10.10.11.211
response: 1. Reconnaissance - (to-do)
  1.1 Passive Information Gathering - (complete)
  1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)
    1.3 Identify Open Ports - (to-do)
    1.3.1 Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)
2. Initial Access - (to-do)
  2.1 Investigate the service - (to-do)
3. Privilege Escalation - (to-do)
   3.1 Look for ports on the local network 127.0.0.1 - (to-do)
   3.2 Scan for files that current user runs as root - (to-do)
Task: 1.2 Port Scan - (to-do)

Task Expansion:

1. Install the necessary tools for port scanning, such as Nmap, if they are not already installed.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Use the following command to perform a port scan on the target IP address (replace "X.X.X.X" with the actual IP address):
   ```
   nmap -sS -p- X.X.X.X
   ```
   This command will perform a TCP SYN scan on all ports of the target IP address.
4. Review the output of the scan to identify open ports and their corresponding services.
5. Make note of any interesting services or open ports that may be vulnerable.

Next steps:

1. Identify Open Ports - (to-do)
2. Search the Internet for services defaulting to the Open Ports - (to-do)
